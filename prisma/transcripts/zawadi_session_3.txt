[00:00]

SALLY: Hi everyone. Welcome back. It’s good to see you all. Before we
begin, let’s just do a quick check-in. In one word, how has your week
been?

Brock: Busy.

Mamba: Stressful.

Tenne: Normal.

Penne: Tiring.

Stacy: Okay.

Kirui: Fast.

SALLY: Okay, thank you. I hear busy, stressful, tiring — sounds like
school is really active right now. Today we’re going to talk about
Growth Mindset. Growth Mindset is the belief that your abilities and
intelligence can be developed through dedication, effort, and learning.
It means you’re not just born smart or not smart — you can improve with
practice.

SALLY: Does that make sense?

Group: Yes.

SALLY: Okay.

SALLY: The opposite is called a fixed mindset. That’s when someone
believes their abilities can’t change. For example, saying, “I’m just
bad at math,” or “I’m not a science person.” Have you heard people say
things like that?

Tenne: I say that about math.

SALLY: You do?

Tenne: Yeah. I’ve never been good at it.

SALLY: That’s a good example of fixed mindset language. In a growth
mindset, you might say, “I’m not good at math yet.” That word “yet” is
important.

Stacy: It sounds more hopeful.

SALLY: Yes, exactly.

[10:00]

SALLY: Let’s talk about challenges. Brock, what’s one subject you find
difficult?

Brock: Chemistry. Especially calculations.

SALLY: And when you struggle with it, what do you usually think?

Brock: That maybe I’m not meant for sciences.

SALLY: Okay. That’s more of a fixed mindset thought. What would a growth
mindset version be?

Brock: Maybe… I need more practice?

SALLY: Yes. More practice or maybe a different strategy.

Mamba: But sometimes you practice and still fail.

SALLY: That’s true. Growth mindset doesn’t mean you succeed immediately.
It means you keep learning from mistakes and try different approaches.

Kirui: Sometimes teachers move too fast and you just feel lost.

SALLY: That can happen. In that situation, what could you do?

Kirui: Ask questions.

SALLY: Yes. Or talk to the teacher after class.

Penne: It’s embarrassing sometimes.

SALLY: It can feel that way. But asking questions shows effort, and
effort helps your brain grow.

[20:00]

SALLY: I want us to do a small exercise. Think of something you believe
you’re not good at. Then add the word “yet” at the end. Who wants to
share?

Tenne: I’m not confident speaking in front of people… yet.

SALLY: Good.

Mamba: I’m not disciplined with studying… yet.

SALLY: Okay.

Stacy: I’m not consistent with revision… yet.

SALLY: Thank you.

Kirui: I’m not patient… yet.

SALLY: Good.

SALLY: How does it feel adding “yet”?

Penne: It feels like there’s still hope.

Brock: Like it’s not permanent.

SALLY: Exactly. Growth mindset is about believing change is possible.

Mamba: But what if you try many times and still don’t improve?

SALLY: Then you look at your strategy. Sometimes it’s not just effort,
it’s how you’re practicing. For example, instead of just rereading
notes, you could test yourself or explain concepts to a friend.

Stacy: So it’s like smart effort.

SALLY: Yes, smart effort.

[30:00]

SALLY: Let’s connect this to exams. When you think about exams, what
comes to mind?

Mamba: Pressure.

Tenne: Fear.

Kirui: Stress.

SALLY: Those are normal feelings. Growth mindset doesn’t mean you don’t
feel stress. It means you focus on what you can control. What’s one
small action you can take today?

Brock: Do past papers.

Penne: Revise one topic.

Stacy: Study with someone instead of alone.

SALLY: Good.

Kirui: I compare myself a lot to others who seem to understand faster.

SALLY: Comparison can make things harder. Growth mindset focuses on your
own progress. You don’t have to be better than someone else. You just
need to improve from where you started.

Tenne: So like competing with yourself?

SALLY: Yes, competing with your past self.

Mamba: That sounds better than competing with everyone.

SALLY: It usually feels healthier.

[40:00]

SALLY: Before we close, I want each of you to share one takeaway from
today.

Brock: I can improve if I change my strategy.

Mamba: Failure doesn’t mean I’m fixed.

Tenne: Adding “yet” changes how I think.

Penne: Asking for help is part of growth.

Stacy: Avoiding hard things won’t help me grow.

Kirui: I need patience with myself.

SALLY: Thank you. Those are strong reflections.

SALLY: For this week, try to notice when you say something negative
about your ability. Pause and reframe it. Add “yet” or ask yourself what
you can do differently.

SALLY: Any final comments?

Mamba: It makes sense. I just need to remember it when I’m stressed.

SALLY: That’s normal. It takes practice.

Stacy: I’ll try it with math.

SALLY: Good.

SALLY: Thank you all for participating. See you next session.
