PATRICIA: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to today's session. Let's check in. How's the week been?

ELIJAH: It was fine. Normal.

ROSE: Mine was stressful. Lots of tests this week.

KIBET: Pretty good actually. I bought new shoes so I'm happy about that.

SANDRA: Average. Nothing interesting happened.

OWINO: Mixed. Some good days, some bad days.

DIANA: Okay. Just tired.

PATRICIA: Thanks for sharing, everyone. I hear some of you had a tough week, and that's actually a great lead-in to what we're going to talk about today. Today's topic is Healthy Thinking Patterns. What I mean by that is looking at how our thoughts affect our feelings and behaviour, and learning to catch patterns that don't serve us well. You know how sometimes you interpret a situation in the worst possible way and then you feel terrible? That's what we're going to work on.

PATRICIA: Let me give you an example. Imagine you send a text to your friend and they don't reply for hours. What goes through your mind?

ROSE: They're mad at me. I said something wrong.

ELIJAH: They're ignoring me on purpose.

SANDRA: Maybe they're busy?

PATRICIA: Interesting. Rose and Elijah went to a negative interpretation. Sandra went neutral. Same situation, but completely different thoughts about it. And here's the thing — the thought you have determines how you feel. If you think "They're mad at me," you feel anxious and start reviewing everything you said. If you think "They're busy," you feel fine and move on with your day. The situation didn't change. Your thought about it changed. This is what psychologists call cognitive distortions — patterns of thinking that distort reality in a negative way.

OWINO: What kind of patterns?

PATRICIA: Good question. There are several, but let me cover the most common ones. The first is catastrophizing — that's when you take a small problem and blow it up into the worst possible scenario. Like, you get one bad grade and you think, "I'm going to fail the whole year and ruin my life." Sound familiar to anyone?

ROSE: That's literally me. Every single exam.

PATRICIA: The second one is black-and-white thinking, or all-or-nothing thinking. That's when you see things in extremes — it's either perfect or it's a disaster. There's no middle ground. Like, "If I can't get an A, what's the point of trying at all?"

KIBET: I do that with football. If I don't score, I think I played badly, even if I had a good game otherwise.

PATRICIA: That's a really good example, Kibet. The third one is mind reading — assuming you know what other people are thinking, usually that they're thinking something negative about you. Like, "Everyone in class thinks I'm stupid." You don't actually know that. But you believe it as if it's a fact.

ELIJAH: I do that all the time. I walk into a room and I'm convinced everyone is judging me.

PATRICIA: And the fourth one I'll mention is personalization — taking everything personally. Something goes wrong and you immediately think it's your fault. Your friend is in a bad mood and you think, "They're upset because of something I did," when actually they just had a bad morning.

DIANA: I do the personalization thing a lot. If someone in my family is upset, I automatically think I caused it.

PATRICIA: These patterns are really common, Diana, and most of us do several of them without realizing it. The good news is that once you can name them, you can start to challenge them.

[00:10]

PATRICIA: So how do you challenge a negative thought? There's a simple process. First, notice the thought. Catch it happening. "Oh, I'm catastrophizing right now." Second, ask yourself: is this thought based on facts or feelings? Just because it feels true doesn't mean it is true. Third, look for evidence. What's the actual evidence for and against this thought? And fourth, reframe it — come up with a more balanced, realistic thought.

PATRICIA: Let's practice with an example. Rose, you said when you get a bad grade you think "I'm going to fail the whole year." Let's work through that. What's the evidence for that thought?

ROSE: Well... I got a bad grade.

PATRICIA: Okay, one bad grade. What's the evidence against it?

ROSE: I've gotten good grades on other tests. And one test isn't the whole year. I guess I've never actually failed a whole year.

PATRICIA: So the balanced thought might be...?

ROSE: "I didn't do well on this test, but that doesn't mean I'll fail the year. I've done well before and I can do well again."

PATRICIA: How does that thought feel compared to the catastrophic one?

ROSE: Less scary. Like, more manageable.

PATRICIA: Exactly. The balanced thought doesn't ignore the problem. You still didn't do well on the test. But it puts it in perspective instead of spiralling into the worst case. Anyone else want to try? Elijah, you mentioned feeling like everyone is judging you when you walk into a room. Let's work through that.

ELIJAH: Okay. The thought is "Everyone is judging me."

PATRICIA: Evidence for?

ELIJAH: I don't know. I just feel it. I feel their eyes on me sometimes.

PATRICIA: So the evidence is a feeling, not a fact. Evidence against?

ELIJAH: Most people are probably thinking about their own stuff. They're probably not paying attention to me at all. And my friends have told me they don't notice half the things I'm insecure about.

PATRICIA: So the balanced thought?

ELIJAH: "Most people aren't thinking about me as much as I think they are. They have their own things going on."

PATRICIA: That's a great reframe. And actually, there's research that backs this up. It's called the spotlight effect — we overestimate how much other people notice and think about us. In reality, most people are focused on themselves.

KIBET: That's actually reassuring. Because I always think people are watching me mess up on the field and judging me for it.

PATRICIA: And they're probably not, Kibet. They're thinking about their own performance. Or what's for dinner. People are remarkably self-focused.

[00:20]

PATRICIA: Let's do a couple more. Sandra, you've been listening — have you noticed any negative thinking patterns in yourself?

SANDRA: Hmm. I think I do the personalisation one. Like, if my friend group is planning something and I'm the last one to hear about it, I immediately think they don't want me there. Like they deliberately left me out.

PATRICIA: And what might the reality be?

SANDRA: Someone probably just forgot to add me to the chat. Or they assumed someone else told me.

PATRICIA: So the balanced thought?

SANDRA: "I wasn't told because of an oversight, not because they don't want me."

PATRICIA: How does that feel?

SANDRA: Better. Less dramatic.

PATRICIA: Right. And if you're still worried, you can always ask. "Hey, I didn't get the message — what's the plan?" That's communication rather than assumption.

OWINO: Mine is a weird one. I don't know if it fits. But I do this thing where if something good happens, I can't enjoy it because I'm already worrying about when it's going to go wrong. Like, if I have a really good day, I think, "Something bad is going to happen to balance this out." I can't just... have a good day.

PATRICIA: Owino, that's not weird at all. That's actually a pattern, and it has a name. It's related to catastrophizing but it's specifically about not trusting good things. It sometimes comes from experience — if you've been let down before, your brain learns to expect it. The reframe here is: "Good things can happen without bad things needing to follow. I'm allowed to enjoy this." It takes practice, but the more you let yourself experience good moments without bracing for disaster, the more your brain learns that it's safe.

OWINO: That makes sense. My mum always says "Don't celebrate too early." Maybe I internalized that.

PATRICIA: That's a common cultural saying, and it comes from a place of wanting to protect you from disappointment. But it can accidentally teach you that joy is dangerous. Joy is not dangerous, Owino. You're allowed to feel it fully.

DIANA: Can I share mine? I think I do catastrophizing but about relationships. Whenever my friends are quiet or seem distant, I immediately assume the friendship is over. Like, they've decided they don't like me anymore and that's it. And then I start pulling away pre-emptively, which actually makes things worse.

PATRICIA: Diana, what you're describing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You fear the friendship ending, so you pull away, which creates distance, which then seems to confirm your fear. But the original thought — "They don't like me anymore" — wasn't based on evidence. It was based on fear. The reframe might be: "They seem distant today, but that could be for many reasons. I'll check in with them instead of pulling away."

DIANA: Yeah. That would be healthier.

[00:30]

PATRICIA: Okay, I want to bring this together. What we've been learning is that our thoughts are not always accurate. They often add drama, worst-case scenarios, and false interpretations to situations that are actually neutral. And those inaccurate thoughts create real emotions — anxiety, sadness, self-doubt, anger. The tool we're building is called cognitive reframing — catching the distorted thought and replacing it with a more balanced one.

PATRICIA: Now, a few important things. First, this isn't about being positive all the time. If something genuinely bad happened, it's okay to feel bad about it. We're not trying to fake happiness. We're trying to make sure our reactions are proportional to what actually happened, not to the story our brain invented. Second, this takes practice. You won't catch every negative thought right away. That's normal. Start by noticing them. Just noticing. Over time, you'll get faster at challenging them.

ELIJAH: It's like training a new reflex.

PATRICIA: Exactly. Your brain has been running these patterns for years, maybe since childhood. Changing them takes repetition. But it absolutely can be done. Third, sometimes the negative thought is accurate. If you genuinely did hurt someone's feelings, the solution isn't to reframe it away — it's to apologize and learn from it. Cognitive reframing is for the thoughts that are distorted, not for every thought.

ROSE: How do you know the difference?

PATRICIA: Good question. Ask yourself: is there concrete evidence for this thought? If a friend told you directly "I'm upset with you," that's evidence. But if your only evidence is a feeling or a guess, that's likely a distortion. Evidence doesn't lie; assumptions do.

KIBET: I like that. Evidence versus assumptions. That's a simple way to check.

PATRICIA: Exactly. Let's do our closing round. What's one negative thought you're going to try to challenge this week?

ELIJAH: "Everyone is judging me." I'm going to remind myself about the spotlight effect. Most people aren't paying attention.

ROSE: "One bad test means I'll fail everything." I'm going to look at the bigger picture and remember all the tests I've done well on.

KIBET: "If I don't score, I played badly." I'm going to focus on all the other things I contribute in a match, not just goals.

SANDRA: "If I wasn't invited, they don't want me." I'm going to ask before I assume.

OWINO: "Something bad will happen after something good." I'm going to try to just enjoy the good without bracing for the bad.

DIANA: "If they're quiet, they hate me." Instead of pulling away, I'll check in and see what's actually going on.

[00:40]

PATRICIA: These are all really solid, everyone. I'm impressed by how quickly you picked up on the concept and applied it to your own lives. Remember — you're not trying to be positive robots. You're trying to be accurate thinkers. There's a big difference. Sometimes things genuinely suck and it's okay to feel bad. But a lot of the time, we're making things worse in our heads than they actually are. Catching that is so powerful.

PATRICIA: One practical tip for the week: when you catch a negative thought, try writing it down. Just on your phone notes, quickly. The thought, and then the reframed version. Over time, you'll build up a collection of reframes that your brain starts to do automatically. It's muscle memory for thinking.

OWINO: Muscle memory for thinking. I like that.

PATRICIA: Alright everyone, that's our time. Thanks for being so open today and for all your examples. I'll see you next week. Take care.

ELIJAH: Thanks, Patricia.

SANDRA: See you next week.

KIBET: Later, everyone.

PATRICIA: Bye!
