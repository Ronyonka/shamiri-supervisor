AMINA: Hey guys, welcome! How are we doing today? Good? Good. Okay so today we're going to talk about gratitude. Basically it's about being thankful for things in your life, even the small things. Like, sometimes we focus too much on what's going wrong and we forget about the good stuff. So gratitude is about shifting focus from what's missing to what's present. Does that make sense?

BARAKA: Yeah, I think so.

AMINA: Great. So the idea is that when you practice gratitude, like regularly, it can actually make you feel happier and more positive. There's even research that shows it can reduce stress and improve your mental health. One way people do this is through a gratitude journal — you just write down three things you're grateful for every day. It sounds simple, right? But it actually works. Okay, so what I want us to do today is go around and each share something you're grateful for. It can be anything, big or small. Small things matter just as much as big ones. Who wants to start? Actually, let's just go in order. Baraka, you go first.

BARAKA: Um, okay. I guess I'm grateful for my mum. She works really hard to make sure we have everything we need. Even when things are tough financially, she never complains. She just keeps going.

AMINA: That's nice, Baraka. Mums are the best, right? Zuri, you're next.

ZURI: I'm grateful for music. Like, when I'm having a bad day, I just put on my headphones and everything feels better. It's like therapy.

AMINA: Music is great. Kipchoge?

KIPCHOGE: I'm grateful for football. Playing with my friends on the weekend is the highlight of my week honestly.

AMINA: Football, nice. Achieng?

ACHIENG: I'm grateful for my best friend Wambui. She's always there for me no matter what.

AMINA: That's sweet. Friends are important. Jabari?

JABARI: I'm grateful for this group, actually. It's nice to have somewhere to come and talk.

AMINA: Aw, thanks Jabari! That means a lot. Nyambura? What about you?

NYAMBURA: Um... I don't know. I'll think about it.

AMINA: Okay, that's fine! So yeah, as you can see, there are lots of things to be grateful for. Even things we take for granted, like music or football or friendships. The point is to notice those things more often. So let's move on to the next part. I want us to talk about how gratitude can help us when things are tough. Like, has anyone been going through something difficult recently where gratitude could help?

[00:10]

BARAKA: I mean, school has been really stressful. I have exams coming up and I feel like I'm not prepared at all. But I guess I could be grateful that I have the chance to go to school? Some people don't even get that.

AMINA: Exactly, exactly! See, that's gratitude. Even in a stressful situation, you can find something positive. Good, Baraka. Anyone else?

ZURI: I've been going through something, actually. But it's not about school.

AMINA: That's okay, you can share whatever you want.

ZURI: It's about my boyfriend. Well, my ex-boyfriend now, I guess. We broke up last week and it's been really hard. I keep thinking about what I did wrong and if I could have done something differently. It's like, I can't concentrate on anything else.

AMINA: Oh no, breakups are the worst. I remember when I went through my first breakup — I literally didn't eat for three days. What happened between you two?

ZURI: He just said he didn't feel the same way anymore. But then I saw him talking to this other girl, Mercy, at school, and they were laughing and looking really close. So I think he left me for her.

AMINA: Wow, that's terrible. Honestly, if he's already talking to another girl after one week, that tells you a lot about his character. You deserve better than that.

ZURI: You think so? My friends keep telling me to text him and try to fix things.

AMINA: No, don't text him. Seriously. If someone doesn't see your value, you shouldn't chase them. You should just focus on yourself. You're young, you'll find someone better. Trust me.

JABARI: I kind of agree with Amina. If he moved on that fast, he wasn't serious.

ACHIENG: But we don't really know the full story though. Maybe Mercy is just a friend?

ZURI: No, you should have seen them. It was not just friends energy.

AMINA: Yeah, I think you know when you know. But look, let's try to bring this back to gratitude. Zuri, even in this situation, is there something you could be grateful for?

ZURI: I guess... I'm grateful for my friends who have been supporting me. Like Achieng and some other girls at school. They've been checking on me.

AMINA: See! Even in a painful situation, there's something positive. Your friends showing up for you — that's something to hold onto. Okay, who else has something to share? Kipchoge, you've been quiet.

KIPCHOGE: I'm okay. Just listening.

AMINA: Alright. What about you, Jabari? Any tough situation where gratitude helped?

JABARI: Hmm, not really. My life is pretty chill right now, to be honest.

AMINA: That's good! That itself is something to be grateful for — having a peaceful period. Sometimes we don't appreciate the calm times until they're gone.

BARAKA: That's actually true. When everything is going fine, you don't even notice it. You only notice when things go bad.

AMINA: Right! And that's kind of the point of gratitude — it makes you notice the good times while they're happening, not just after they're gone. Okay, so let me tell you about another way to practice gratitude. Besides the gratitude journal, you can also practice gratitude by telling people directly. Like, when was the last time you told your mum "thank you"? Or told a friend how much you appreciate them? We think it, but we don't always say it.

[00:20]

ACHIENG: I tell Wambui all the time. I literally sent her a text yesterday saying "I'm glad you're my friend."

AMINA: That's great, Achieng! More people should do that. It makes the other person feel good and it makes you feel good too. It's a win-win.

BARAKA: I don't really do that. It would feel awkward telling my friends I appreciate them. Like, guys don't really talk like that.

JABARI: Yeah, same. If I told my boys "I appreciate you," they'd think something was wrong with me.

AMINA: Haha, I get that. But it doesn't have to be that deep. You can show appreciation in different ways. It doesn't have to be a whole speech. Even just showing up for your friends, or helping them out — that's a form of gratitude too. Actions count.

KIPCHOGE: I think actions are easier for guys. Like, if my friend needs help moving something, I'll just show up. That says more than words anyway.

AMINA: Sure, that works too. Okay, so let me ask you all this — do you think gratitude is something you're born with, or something you can practice and get better at?

BARAKA: Practice, I think. Some days it's harder to be grateful than others.

AMINA: Yeah, that's true. It's definitely a practice. That's why the gratitude journal is so effective — because you're literally training your brain to look for the good stuff. The more you do it, the more natural it becomes. And you don't need a fancy journal. You can just use your phone. Every night before bed, write down three things from that day that you're grateful for. They can be tiny — like, "I'm grateful that it didn't rain today" or "I'm grateful for that chapati I had for lunch." Small things matter.

NYAMBURA: What if you really can't think of anything? Like, what if your day was genuinely terrible?

AMINA: Hmm, that's a good question. I think even on the worst days, there's something. Even if it's just "I'm grateful I got through the day." But honestly, yeah, some days are harder. You don't have to force it. The point is the overall practice, not being perfect at it every single day.

ZURI: Going back to what we were talking about earlier, I've been trying to keep track of good things since the breakup. Like, my friend told me to write down one good thing about every day. And at first I thought it was stupid, but actually it did help a little. Like, it forces my brain to think about something other than him.

AMINA: That's exactly it, Zuri. That's basically a gratitude journal. And I'm glad it's helping. It's about training your brain to look in a different direction. Not ignoring the pain, but giving your brain something else to hold onto as well.

ZURI: But can I be honest? Sometimes when people tell you to be grateful, it feels like they're dismissing your problems. Like, "Oh, you're sad? Just be grateful!" It doesn't work like that.

AMINA: You know what, that's a really fair point. Gratitude isn't about pretending everything is fine or dismissing your problems. It's more like... holding two things at the same time. You can be sad about a breakup AND grateful for your friends. Both things can be true. It's not one or the other.

JABARI: That makes more sense. Because my older brother always tells me "Other people have it worse" when I'm upset, and it just makes me angry. Like, that doesn't help at all.

AMINA: Yeah, comparing your suffering to others isn't really gratitude. That's more like guilt. And guilt doesn't help anyone. Real gratitude is about your own experience — noticing what's good in your life, for you.

[00:30]

AMINA: Okay, let's do a little activity. I want each of you to think about one person in your life you haven't thanked properly, and tell us who it is and why you'd want to thank them. Don't worry about actually doing it right now — just think about who it would be. Who wants to go?

BARAKA: My older sister. She helped me so much when I was preparing for my KCPE exams. She would stay up late reviewing my work even though she had her own university assignments. I don't think I ever properly thanked her for that.

AMINA: That's really lovely, Baraka. Sisters can be amazing.

ACHIENG: Mine is my grandmother. She raised me when my parents were working in Nairobi. I lived with her from like age five to age twelve. She taught me how to cook, how to pray, how to be kind. I call her sometimes but I don't think I've ever told her how much those years meant to me.

AMINA: You should tell her, Achieng. That would probably mean the world to her. Old people love hearing that stuff. I mean — older people. Your grandma would appreciate it.

JABARI: Mine is actually a teacher. Mr. Odhiambo. He teaches math, and I used to be terrible at math. Like, failing terrible. But he would stay after school and help me. He never made me feel stupid. He always said "You just need a different explanation." I went from a D to a B because of him.

AMINA: That's a great one. Teachers don't get enough appreciation honestly. Kipchoge?

KIPCHOGE: I'd say my dad. He wakes up at 4 AM every day to go to work so that we can go to school. He never complains. He's not the type to talk about feelings or anything, but you can see in everything he does that he cares. I've never told him I notice that.

AMINA: Kipchoge, that actually really hit me. That's beautiful. Dads don't always say it, but they show it. And sometimes they need to hear that we see it. Nyambura, what about you?

NYAMBURA: I... I'm not sure. I'll pass.

AMINA: That's okay! No pressure. Zuri?

ZURI: I actually want to thank my mum too. When I told her about the breakup, she didn't judge me or say "I told you so." She just held me and let me cry. I thought she'd be angry because she didn't really approve of the relationship, but she just chose to be there for me. That surprised me.

AMINA: Mums can surprise us like that. When it really matters, they show up. I love that. You know, Zuri, speaking of your mum — that's actually a perfect example of what gratitude can do. When you recognize how your mum showed up for you, doesn't it change how you feel, even just a tiny bit?

ZURI: Yeah, it does actually. Like, even though I'm still sad about the breakup, thinking about my mum being there makes me feel like I have people in my corner.

AMINA: Exactly. And that's the power of gratitude. It doesn't erase the bad stuff. But it reminds you of the good stuff that's also there. You were asking earlier if gratitude dismisses problems — it doesn't. It balances them out. Gives you a fuller picture.

[00:40]

AMINA: Okay, so we're getting towards the end of our time. Let me just ask — did anyone learn something new today or think about something differently?

BARAKA: I think the thing about holding two things at once — being sad and grateful at the same time. I never thought about it that way. I always thought you had to pick one. Like, either you're having a bad day or a good day. But actually it can be both.

AMINA: Yeah, life is complex like that. It's rarely just one thing.

JABARI: For me, I liked the idea of thanking people out loud. Not just thinking it. I want to actually tell Mr. Odhiambo thank you. Maybe I'll write him a note or something.

AMINA: Do it! He'd love that. Achieng, anything for you?

ACHIENG: I'm going to call my grandmother tonight. For real this time. I always say I will and then I get busy. But today reminded me that I shouldn't take her for granted. She's getting older.

AMINA: That's beautiful, Achieng. I'm sure she'd love to hear from you. What about everyone else? Anything sticking with you?

KIPCHOGE: I liked this session. I don't usually talk much in groups, but this was alright. The gratitude journal thing — I might try it. Not writing it down necessarily, but maybe just thinking about three things before I sleep.

AMINA: That works too! It doesn't have to be written down. Just the mental exercise of thinking about it is enough. Zuri, how are you feeling?

ZURI: Better than when I walked in, honestly. I came in thinking about my ex and now I'm thinking about my mum and my friends. So I guess gratitude does work.

AMINA: I'm really glad to hear that, Zuri. And honestly — about the boy situation — just give it time. You'll be okay. You're strong and you have good people around you. Don't settle for someone who doesn't recognize what they have. Okay?

ZURI: Okay. Thanks, Amina.

AMINA: Nyambura, I noticed you were a bit quiet today. That's totally fine — you don't have to share if you don't want to. But I just want you to know that you're welcome here and whenever you feel like contributing, we'd love to hear from you.

NYAMBURA: Thanks. I'm just not in a great space today, but I appreciate being here. Just listening was good.

AMINA: I'm glad you came. That itself is something, right? Okay, everyone, so for this week, my challenge to you is this: try doing a gratitude journal, even just on your phone. Three things a day that you're grateful for. See how it makes you feel after a few days. And if you want, you can also try telling one person in your life that you appreciate them. See what happens.

BARAKA: I'll try it.

JABARI: Same.

ACHIENG: I'm definitely calling my grandma.

AMINA: Love it. Alright, guys, that's it for today. Thank you for coming, thank you for sharing, and I'll see you next week. Take care of yourselves!

BARAKA: Thanks, Amina.

KIPCHOGE: See you next week.

ZURI: Bye, everyone.

AMINA: Bye!
