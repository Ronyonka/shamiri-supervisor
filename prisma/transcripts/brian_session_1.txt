BRIAN: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to today's session. Thanks for showing up. So before we get started, let's do a quick check-in. How is everyone today? Just one word or a short sentence — how are you feeling right now?

AMANI: I'm good. Had a decent week.

HALIMA: Tired. But I'm here.

OTIENO: I'm alright. A bit bored, honestly, but alright.

WANJIKU: Happy! My cousin is visiting this weekend so I'm excited.

MWANGI: I'm okay.

LINET: I'm fine. A little stressed about school but fine.

BRIAN: Thanks, everyone. Halima, I hear you on the tiredness — hopefully this session gives you a bit of a boost. And Linet, school stress is real, we'll actually talk about managing that kind of pressure today in a way. So, today's topic is Self-Compassion. Has anyone heard of that word before? Self-compassion?

WANJIKU: Is it like... being nice to yourself?

BRIAN: Yeah, that's pretty much the core of it. Self-compassion means treating yourself with the same kindness you would treat a good friend. So think about it — when your friend is going through a hard time, what do you do? You listen, you encourage them, you tell them it's going to be okay. But when we go through a hard time ourselves, a lot of us do the opposite. We beat ourselves up. We say things to ourselves that we would never say to someone we care about.

AMANI: That's true. I'm way harder on myself than I am on my friends.

BRIAN: Right. And that's really common. Self-compassion has three parts, basically. First, there's self-kindness — being warm to yourself instead of critical. Second, there's common humanity — recognizing that everyone struggles, you're not the only one. And third, there's mindfulness — being aware of your feelings without exaggerating them or ignoring them. Together, these three things make up self-compassion.

LINET: So it's like not being your own worst enemy?

BRIAN: Exactly, Linet. That's a great way to put it. A lot of us are our own worst critics. And the thing is, being harsh on yourself doesn't actually help you do better. Research shows that people who practice self-compassion are actually more motivated, not less. Because when you're not afraid of beating yourself up for failing, you're more willing to try new things.

HALIMA: Hmm, I've never thought about it that way. I always thought being hard on yourself was what pushed you to succeed.

BRIAN: That's a really common belief, Halima. And I get why — our culture often tells us that discipline means being tough on yourself. But there's a difference between holding yourself accountable and tearing yourself apart. Self-compassion isn't about lowering your standards. It's about how you talk to yourself when you don't meet them. Instead of "I'm such a failure," it could be "That didn't go well, but I can learn from it and try again."

[00:10]

BRIAN: So let me give you an example. Imagine you studied really hard for an exam and you still didn't do well. What's the first thing you'd say to yourself?

OTIENO: "I'm stupid." That's what I'd think.

LINET: Same. Or like, "What's the point of even trying?"

BRIAN: And those are really harsh statements, right? Now imagine your best friend came to you and said they studied hard and still failed. Would you tell them they're stupid?

OTIENO: No, obviously not. I'd tell them it's just one exam, it doesn't define them.

BRIAN: Exactly. So why do you deserve less compassion than your friend? That's the question self-compassion asks. You deserve the same kindness you give others. Okay, so I want to open this up. Can anyone share a time when they were really hard on themselves? And how did that inner critic sound?

AMANI: I can go. Last month I was supposed to lead a presentation in class for our group project. And I froze completely. I stood up in front of everyone and my mind just went blank. I could hear people whispering and I just stood there. Eventually the teacher let me sit down. I wanted to disappear. For the rest of that day, I kept telling myself I'm a joke, I'm pathetic, everyone's laughing at me.

BRIAN: Amani, thank you for sharing that. That sounds like a really painful experience. Freezing up in front of people — that's one of the most common fears people have. And the things you were telling yourself afterward — "I'm a joke, I'm pathetic" — those are really harsh. Do you think you'd say those things to a friend who froze during a presentation?

AMANI: No. I'd tell them it happens to everyone and they'll do better next time.

BRIAN: So what would it look like to give yourself that same message?

AMANI: I guess... "It happens. It doesn't mean I'm pathetic. I just got nervous. I can try again."

BRIAN: How does it feel to say that?

AMANI: Weird. But also... kind of a relief? Like the pressure goes down a little.

BRIAN: That's self-compassion working. It's not about denying that the situation was hard. It was hard. But it's about responding to yourself with understanding instead of cruelty. Anyone else? Wanjiku?

WANJIKU: Mine isn't as dramatic, but I'm really hard on myself about my body. Like, I compare myself to other girls at school and I always feel like I'm not skinny enough or pretty enough. I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it. And then I get angry at myself for caring about it, which makes it worse.

BRIAN: Wanjiku, that's actually really important to share, and I appreciate your honestly. Body image is something a lot of young people struggle with, and it's made worse by social media showing these perfect — and often fake — images all the time. The self-compassion approach here would be to first acknowledge the feeling: "I'm feeling insecure about my body right now." Then remind yourself that millions of people feel this way — it's part of being human, especially at your age. And then be kind to yourself: "My worth isn't determined by how I look."

WANJIKU: That sounds nice in theory. Harder to actually believe.

BRIAN: You're right, and that's honest. Self-compassion is a practice. It takes time. You don't have to believe it fully right away. You just have to start saying it and keep saying it until it starts to sink in. It's like building a new habit. Mwangi, you've been quiet. Anything you'd like to share? No pressure.

MWANGI: I don't know. I just... I'm hard on myself about a lot of things. Everything, really. School, at home, with friends. Sometimes I feel like nothing I do matters.

BRIAN: What do you mean by that, Mwangi?

MWANGI: Like, I try to do well in school and it's never enough. My dad always says I need to do better. I try to help at home and I always mess something up. I try to be a good friend and people still leave. It's like, what's the point?

BRIAN: That sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight, Mwangi. And I hear you — when you feel like your best isn't enough, it's exhausting. That's exactly where self-compassion comes in. You need to recognize that you're doing your best given what you're going through.

MWANGI: Yeah, but sometimes doing your best doesn't change anything. I just don't see the point anymore of trying so hard when nothing ever works out.

[00:20]

BRIAN: Mwangi, I can tell this is really weighing on you. And those feelings are valid — when you're putting in effort and not seeing results, it's natural to feel drained. But I want to encourage you not to give up. Things do get better. Sometimes we're in a tough season and it feels like it'll last forever, but it won't.

HALIMA: It's true, Mwangi. I've had times where I felt like everything was pointless too, but things turned around eventually.

MWANGI: It's not just a season, though. It's been like this for a while. Like, months. Sometimes I think everyone would be fine without me. Like, I don't really add anything.

LINET: Don't say that, Mwangi. That's not true.

OTIENO: Yeah, bro. We'd definitely notice if you weren't here.

BRIAN: They're right, Mwangi. You matter. The fact that you're here today, sharing this with us, that takes courage. And I think what you're experiencing is what happens when we don't practice self-compassion — that inner critic gets so loud that it drowns everything else out. You start to believe the worst things about yourself. But those thoughts aren't facts. They're just thoughts. And they can change.

MWANGI: I guess.

BRIAN: One thing you could try is this — next time that voice in your head says "Nothing I do matters," try to pause and ask yourself: "Would I say this to a friend?" And then try to give yourself the kinder response. It won't feel natural at first, but over time, it can help quiet that critic.

MWANGI: I'll try.

BRIAN: Good. And look, we're all here for you. That's part of what this group is about. Okay, let me keep us moving. I want to do a quick exercise. I want each of you to write down — or just think of — one negative thing you regularly say to yourself and then rewrite it as something a compassionate friend would say. Let's share when you're ready.

LINET: Mine is "I'm not smart enough." The compassionate version would be... "I'm learning, and it takes time. Not understanding something right away doesn't mean I'm not smart."

BRIAN: That's a really good reframe, Linet. Really strong.

OTIENO: I always tell myself I'm lazy. But I think the truth is I get overwhelmed and then I shut down. So maybe the kinder version is "I'm not lazy, I'm overwhelmed, and I need to break things down into smaller steps."

BRIAN: That's excellent, Otieno. And there's actually research that supports what you just said. What we often label as laziness is frequently overwhelm, anxiety, or lack of clarity. Recognizing that is a form of self-compassion. Halima?

HALIMA: I tell myself I'm too emotional. I cry a lot and people have made fun of me for it. The self-compassion version would be... "Feeling deeply is not a weakness. It means I'm human and I care."

BRIAN: That's beautiful, Halima. Being emotional is not a flaw. It's actually closely connected to empathy, which is a real strength. Society sometimes tells us that showing emotion is weak, but it takes more strength to be honest about how you feel than to pretend everything's fine.

WANJIKU: Mine is about my body, like I said. I always think "I'm not pretty enough." The kinder version... "My body does so much for me every day. I should appreciate it instead of criticizing it."

BRIAN: That's a really mature reframe, Wanjiku. Shifting from what your body looks like to what your body does for you — that's a powerful perspective change.

[00:30]

BRIAN: Mwangi, did you think of one? You don't have to share if you don't want to.

MWANGI: I guess mine is "I'm not good enough." For anything. School, family, friends. The kinder version... I don't know. Maybe "I'm doing my best with what I have, even if it doesn't feel like it."

BRIAN: That's a really honest and powerful reframe, Mwangi. "I'm doing my best with what I have." That acknowledges the struggle without adding cruelty on top of it. That's real self-compassion.

AMANI: Mine is "Everyone thinks I'm weird." The compassionate version would be "Not everyone will get me, and that's okay. The people who matter will appreciate me for who I am."

BRIAN: I love that, Amani. You don't need everyone's approval. You just need to be authentically yourself. Alright, so these reframes are really impressive, everyone. I can tell you all thought deeply about them. The fact that you can create these kinder versions shows that you already know how to be compassionate — you just need to start directing some of that compassion inward.

BRIAN: Now, let me mention one more important thing about self-compassion. It also means knowing when to ask for help. Being kind to yourself sometimes means recognizing that you can't carry everything alone. Whether it's talking to a friend, a family member, a teacher, or a counselor — reaching out is strength, not weakness. We all need support sometimes.

HALIMA: That's hard though. Asking for help feels like admitting you've failed.

BRIAN: I understand why it feels that way, Halima. But think about it — if your friend came to you for help, would you think they failed?

HALIMA: No. I'd think they were brave.

BRIAN: Exactly. So give yourself that same grace. Asking for help is one of the most self-compassionate things you can do. Okay, let's talk about some practical ways to build self-compassion into your daily life. One thing you can do is a self-compassion pause. When something goes wrong and you start beating yourself up, you stop and say three things: "This is a moment of suffering" — that's mindfulness. "Suffering is part of life" — that's common humanity. And "May I be kind to myself" — that's self-kindness. It sounds a bit formal, but you can put it in your own words. The point is to slow down instead of spiraling into self-criticism.

OTIENO: That's actually practical. I could see myself doing that.

AMANI: It's kind of like a reset button for your brain.

BRIAN: That's a great way to think about it, Amani. A reset button. Another thing you can do is write yourself a letter from the perspective of a compassionate friend. Like, if your friend saw everything you were going through, what would they write to you? It might feel awkward, but a lot of people find it really powerful.

LINET: I might try that. I journal sometimes, so it wouldn't be too different.

[00:40]

BRIAN: Great. Okay, we're heading toward the end, so I want to go around one more time. What's your biggest takeaway from today? What's sticking with you?

AMANI: That I should talk to myself the way I talk to my friends. I'd never call my friend pathetic for freezing during a presentation. I shouldn't call myself that either.

BRIAN: Perfect takeaway, Amani.

HALIMA: For me, it's that being emotional isn't weak. I've been called "too sensitive" my whole life and I always believed it was a bad thing. But maybe it's not.

BRIAN: It's definitely not, Halima. Your sensitivity is a gift.

OTIENO: I'm going to try to catch myself when I call myself lazy. Because you're right — I think I'm mostly just overwhelmed. Calling myself lazy just makes me shut down more.

BRIAN: That self-awareness is huge, Otieno. Recognizing the pattern is the first step to changing it.

WANJIKU: My takeaway is the idea of thanking my body instead of criticizing it. Like, my legs carry me everywhere, my hands let me write and create things. I never think about that. I just look in the mirror and focus on flaws. I want to change that.

BRIAN: That's a beautiful intention, Wanjiku. I hope you hold onto that.

LINET: I liked the self-compassion pause. Mindfulness, common humanity, self-kindness. I'm going to try it next time I bomb a test and start spiraling.

BRIAN: That's the perfect situation to use it, Linet. Mwangi?

MWANGI: I don't know. I think the whole thing about treating yourself like a friend is nice. I'm just not sure I believe it for myself yet. But I'll think about it.

BRIAN: That's completely okay, Mwangi. You don't have to believe it right away. Just keep showing up and keep thinking about it. Self-compassion is a journey, not a switch you flip. And I'm glad you were honest about where you are with it. That honesty is itself a form of self-awareness.

BRIAN: Alright everyone, my challenge for you this week is this: try to catch your inner critic at least once. When you hear that harsh voice — "I'm not good enough," "I'm stupid," "I'm too much" — pause. And try to respond the way a friend would. Even if you don't fully believe it yet. Just try. And if you want, you can share your experience next time we meet.

OTIENO: I'm going to try it with school. Every time I get a bad grade, I destroy myself mentally. I want to stop doing that.

BRIAN: That's a great goal, Otieno. Be patient with yourself. It takes time to change patterns that have been there for years. But the fact that you want to change — that's already progress.

[00:50]

BRIAN: Okay, that's our session for today. Thank you all for being so open and vulnerable. This was a really meaningful conversation and I'm proud of all of you for engaging with it. Remember — you deserve the same kindness you give others. Don't forget that. I'll see you all next week.

AMANI: Thanks, Brian. This was helpful.

WANJIKU: Yeah, I liked this one.

OTIENO: See you next week.

HALIMA: Bye, everyone.

MWANGI: Bye.

LINET: Bye! See you next week.

BRIAN: Take care, everyone. Be kind to yourselves this week.
