EUNICE: Hey everyone, good to see you all again. How are we today? Let's do a quick temperature check — on a scale of one to ten, where ten is amazing and one is really rough, where are you at?

IMANI: I'd say a six. Not bad, not great.

ERICK: Seven. Football practice was good today so I'm feeling alright.

NAOMI: Maybe a four. I didn't sleep well.

RASHID: Eight. I'm in a good mood today, no specific reason.

CHRISTINE: Five. Just average.

TITUS: Two.

EUNICE: Thank you all for being honest. Naomi, I hope we can help you feel a bit more rested after this — at least mentally. And Titus, a two sounds like you're having a really tough time. We'll make sure there's space for you today. So, today's session is about coping with stress. I picked this topic because I think every single one of us deals with stress on a regular basis and we don't always talk about what actually works to manage it. Can anyone tell me what stress feels like most in your body?

ERICK: For me, my shoulders get really tight. Like, I hold all my tension up here.

NAOMI: I get headaches. And my stomach hurts. When I'm really stressed, I can't eat.

CHRISTINE: My heart races. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack even when nothing outwardly bad is happening.

EUNICE: These are all really common physical responses to stress, and I'm glad you mentioned them because a lot of people don't realize that stress lives in the body, not just the mind. When your brain perceives a threat — even an emotional one like an upcoming exam or a conflict with a friend — it triggers your fight-or-flight response. That's what causes the tight shoulders, the stomach aches, the racing heart. Your body is literally preparing you to fight or flee, even if there's no physical danger. Understanding that can actually help you manage it, because it means you can use your body to calm your mind.

RASHID: What do you mean, use your body?

EUNICE: Great question. So one of the most effective stress management techniques is something called deep breathing or diaphragmatic breathing. When you're stressed, your breathing gets shallow and fast — chest breathing. If you deliberately slow your breathing down and breathe from your belly, you activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which is the part of your nervous system that calms you down. It literally tells your brain, "We're safe. We can relax." Can we try it together?

IMANI: Sure.

EUNICE: Okay. Everyone sit comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Now breathe in slowly through your nose for four counts — one, two, three, four. Feel your belly push out, not your chest. Now hold for four counts — one, two, three, four. Now exhale slowly through your mouth for six counts — one, two, three, four, five, six. Let's do that three more times together.

EUNICE: How does that feel?

NAOMI: Actually kind of nice. I feel slightly less tense.

ERICK: My shoulders dropped. I didn't even realize how high they were.

EUNICE: That's the beauty of it. It takes thirty seconds and you can do it anywhere — before an exam, during a difficult conversation, even when you're lying in bed trying to sleep. It sounds too simple to work, but your nervous system responds to it every time. Okay, so deep breathing is one tool. Let's talk about what else we can put in our stress management toolkit.

[00:10]

EUNICE: I want to share a concept called the stress bucket. Imagine you have a bucket, and every stressor in your life fills it — school, family, friendships, expectations, health stuff, money worries, the future. As the bucket fills, you start to feel overwhelmed. If it overflows, that's when we break down, snap at people, get sick, or shut down completely. Now, the goal isn't to have an empty bucket — some stress is normal and even healthy. The goal is to have a tap at the bottom of the bucket that lets some of the water out. That tap represents your coping strategies. Exercise, talking to a friend, journaling, creative hobbies, prayer or meditation, spending time in nature, even just getting enough sleep — these all open the tap and let stress drain out. Make sense?

RASHID: I like that analogy. My bucket is pretty full but my tap is... not very open.

EUNICE: What do you mean by that, Rashid?

RASHID: I don't really have coping strategies. When I'm stressed, I just push through until it passes. Or I distract myself with my phone. But I don't think scrolling TikTok actually reduces stress. It just delays it.

EUNICE: That's a really honest and self-aware observation. And you're right — distraction is different from coping. Distraction gives temporary relief, but the stress is still in the bucket. Coping actually processes the stress and lets some of it go. What about everyone else — what's currently in your coping toolkit? Things that genuinely help?

IMANI: Music. When I put on my playlist and just zone out, it genuinely helps. Not as distraction, but like it changes my mood.

ERICK: Football. Running around and kicking things is basically therapy for me.

NAOMI: I write in my journal sometimes. Not every day, but when things get really bad, I write down everything I'm feeling and it helps me make sense of it.

EUNICE: These are all excellent coping strategies, and notice why they work — music shifts your emotional state, exercise releases endorphins and processes physical tension, journaling helps you organize and externalize your thoughts. They're not just distractions. They're actively helping your brain and body process the stress. Christine, what about you?

CHRISTINE: I talk to my best friend. She's really good at listening. But sometimes I feel like I'm burdening her with my problems. So lately I've been keeping things to myself more.

EUNICE: Christine, it sounds like you have a really valuable resource in that friendship, but you're worried about overusing it. That concern actually shows how much you care about the relationship. Have you asked her if she feels burdened?

CHRISTINE: No. I just assume she is because I would feel burdened if someone was always coming to me with heavy stuff.

EUNICE: So you might be projecting your own feelings onto her. She might genuinely not feel burdened at all. It might be worth having an honest conversation — something like, "I appreciate that you listen to me. I want to make sure I'm not overwhelming you." Her answer might surprise you. And remember, letting people support you isn't weakness — it's one of the most effective coping strategies there is. Titus, what about you? What helps when you're stressed?

TITUS: Nothing really works anymore. I used to play basketball but I stopped. I used to draw but I stopped. I used to hang out with friends but I stopped doing that too. I just kind of exist now.

EUNICE: Titus, I hear you saying you've pulled away from a lot of things that used to bring you some relief. That sounds like it's been a gradual process?

TITUS: Yeah. Over the past few months. I just lost interest in everything. Nothing feels worth the effort anymore. I wake up and I'm already tired even though I slept.

[00:20]

EUNICE: Titus, thank you for being so honest with us. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, and the fact that things you used to enjoy don't feel rewarding anymore — that's a heavy experience. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

TITUS: I don't know. It's everything. School feels pointless. My parents fight all the time. I feel like I'm just a spectator in my own life, watching everything happen but not really being part of it. Sometimes I think about just disappearing. Not being anywhere. Just... not existing.

IMANI: Titus...

ERICK: Bro, we're here for you.

EUNICE: Titus, I really appreciate you sharing something so personal with this group. It takes an enormous amount of courage. When you say "not existing" — can you tell me more about what you mean by that?

TITUS: I don't mean like... I'm not going to do anything. It's more like a wish. Like, I wish I could just pause. Press a button and stop everything. Stop feeling. Stop having to deal with all of it. But there's no pause button, so you just keep going even though you don't want to.

EUNICE: I hear you, and what you're describing — wanting everything to just stop — that comes from a place of real pain and exhaustion. You've been dealing with a lot, and when your bucket has been overflowing for months with no tap open, that feeling of wanting it all to stop makes sense. It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you — it means you're overwhelmed and you need support.

NAOMI: We're all here for you, Titus. Seriously. You can talk to us.

EUNICE: And that's true — this group cares about you. I want to ask you something, Titus. Outside of this group, is there someone in your life you trust that you can talk to about how you've been feeling? A family member, a teacher, a counselor?

TITUS: Not really. My parents are too caught up in their own issues. And I don't want to bother anyone.

EUNICE: You're not a bother, Titus. You feeling this way matters. And I want you to know that what you're experiencing — losing interest in things, feeling exhausted, feeling disconnected — these are signs that you could really benefit from talking to someone who's trained to help. Like a counselor. It's not about being weak or broken. It's about getting the support you deserve. Would you be open to that?

TITUS: Maybe. I don't know. I've never talked to a counselor before.

EUNICE: That's completely understandable. It can feel scary to take that step. Tell you what — after the session, can you and I chat for a few minutes? I'd like to share some options with you. Nothing pressured, just information. Is that okay?

TITUS: Yeah. Okay.

EUNICE: Thank you, Titus. And I want you to know — the fact that you shared what you're going through today, in front of everyone? That's not weakness. That's strength. You reached out, even if it didn't feel like it. That matters.

RASHID: For real, Titus. We've got your back.

CHRISTINE: Always.

EUNICE: Okay. I want to come back to the group, but I want to acknowledge what just happened. Titus trusted us with something really heavy, and you all responded with compassion. That's what supportive relationships look like. Now, I also want to say something important — if any of you ever feel the way Titus described, or if you notice a friend acting differently, withdrawing, losing interest in things — please reach out. Talk to someone you trust. Talk to me. There are people who can help. You don't have to carry it alone.

[00:30]

EUNICE: Let's continue with the session, and Titus, participate as much or as little as you feel comfortable with, okay?

TITUS: Okay.

EUNICE: So we talked about the stress bucket and coping strategies. I want to introduce one more framework that I find really helpful. It's the idea of controllables versus uncontrollables. When we're stressed, a lot of our mental energy goes to things we can't control — what other people think of us, the outcome of a situation, the past, the weather, traffic. And while it's natural to worry about those things, they drain us because no amount of worrying changes them. The shift that helps is focusing your energy on what you can control — your effort, your attitude, your response, who you spend time with, how you take care of yourself. Can we practice this? Let me throw out some situations and tell me — controllable or uncontrollable?

EUNICE: Your classmate spreads a rumour about you.

IMANI: The rumour itself is uncontrollable. But how I respond to it is controllable.

EUNICE: Perfect. Your parents are arguing at home.

RASHID: Uncontrollable. You can't stop them from fighting. But you can control whether you have a plan for when it happens — like going to your room or calling a friend.

EUNICE: Really thoughtful answer, Rashid. And that connects directly to Titus's experience — when there's conflict at home, it fills your bucket fast, and you need coping strategies to open that tap. Okay, another one: you have an exam tomorrow and you don't feel prepared.

NAOMI: The exam is happening no matter what, so that's uncontrollable. But I can still revise tonight and do my best with the time I have. That's controllable.

EUNICE: Exactly. Focusing on controllables doesn't eliminate the stress. But it gives you agency. Instead of spiralling about everything that could go wrong, you channel your energy into the things you can actually do. And that tends to reduce stress significantly because you feel less helpless.

ERICK: This is actually really useful. I stress about football trials all the time — what if I don't make the team? But you're saying I should focus on how I train, not on whether I make the team?

EUNICE: Exactly, Erick. Train the best you can, prepare the best you can, and let the outcome be what it will be. You'll still feel nervous — that's normal. But you won't feel as overwhelmed because you know you did what was in your power.

CHRISTINE: I need to apply this to school. I spend so much time worrying about my final grade that I can't even focus on the actual studying. The worry eats up the time I could use to prepare.

EUNICE: Christine, that's such a perceptive observation. Worry about outcomes often steals the energy and time you'd need to actually control the process. It's a cycle: worry about the grade, can't focus on studying, don't study well, get a bad grade, more worry about the next one. Breaking the cycle starts with pulling your focus back to the process — what can I study right now? — and letting go of the outcome, at least in this moment.

[00:40]

EUNICE: Alright, let's start wrapping up. I want to summarize what we covered. First, stress lives in the body as much as the mind — tight shoulders, headaches, racing heart. Second, we learned a practical tool: deep breathing, which activates your calming nervous system. Third, we talked about the stress bucket — your coping strategies are the tap that drains the stress. Fourth, we explored controllables versus uncontrollables, and the power of focusing your energy on what you can actually influence. And through all of this, we heard from each other — honestly and bravely.

EUNICE: For our closing round, I want each of you to share one coping strategy you're going to try or recommit to this week. Something specific.

IMANI: I'm going to create a specific playlist — not just random songs, but songs that actually shift my mood when I'm stressed. A stress playlist.

EUNICE: I love the intentionality behind that. Curating it means you'll have it ready when you need it.

ERICK: I'm going to keep up with football but also add the deep breathing. Before I go to sleep, when I'm lying in bed overthinking, I'll do the four-four-six breathing.

EUNICE: That's a great combination — physical exercise plus breathing. Your nervous system will thank you.

NAOMI: I want to journal more consistently. Not just when I'm at breaking point, but like a maintenance thing. Maybe a few times a week.

EUNICE: Preventive journaling — I love that frame. Don't wait until the bucket overflows. Drain a little regularly.

RASHID: I need to find a tap. For real. I'm going to try going for walks. Nothing intense. Just walking around the neighborhood after school and seeing if it helps.

EUNICE: Walking is one of the most underrated stress relievers. The combination of gentle movement, fresh air, and a change of scenery is incredibly effective. Try it, Rashid.

CHRISTINE: I'm going to talk to my friend. Have that honest conversation about whether she feels burdened. And if she doesn't, I'll let myself lean on her more.

EUNICE: That takes courage, Christine. And it's also a great example of moving from assumption to communication. Beautiful.

TITUS: I think... I'm going to talk to Eunice after this. And maybe try drawing again. Even if it's just doodles. I miss it.

EUNICE: Titus, both of those are really meaningful steps. And doodling counts. Any creative expression that lets your mind process without words — that's a powerful tap for your bucket. I'm proud of you for saying that.

[00:48]

EUNICE: One last thing before we go. I want you all to remember something: stress is not a sign of failure. It's a sign that you care, that you're engaged, that you're dealing with real life. The goal isn't to eliminate stress — that's impossible. The goal is to have tools to manage it so it doesn't control you. You all have tools now. Use them. And if one doesn't work, try another. And if nothing seems to work and you're feeling overwhelmed — reach out. To a friend, to this group, to me, or to a professional. There is always help available.

EUNICE: I'll see everyone next week. Titus, hang back for a minute?

TITUS: Yeah.

RASHID: Take care, everyone.

IMANI: Bye! See you next week.

ERICK: Later, guys.

NAOMI: Bye.

CHRISTINE: Bye, everyone. And Titus — we're here for you. Always.

EUNICE: Thanks, everyone. See you next week.
