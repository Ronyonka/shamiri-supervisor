JAMES: Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome back. It's really good to see all of you here today. How is everyone doing? Just a quick check-in — give me one word that describes how your week has been.

FRANK: Busy.

FRANCINE: Tiring, honestly.

TYLER: Fun. I had a good week.

PERRY: Stressful.

MAXINE: Okay, I guess. Just okay.

OMONDI: Confusing.

JAMES: Thank you all for sharing. I appreciate the honesty. Perry, you said stressful — I hope today's session gives you something helpful to think about. And Omondi, confusing — we can talk more about that if you'd like. Today's topic actually connects to how we handle those tough moments. So let's jump in. Today we're going to talk about something called Growth Mindset. Has anyone heard that phrase before?

TYLER: I think I've heard it in a YouTube video or something. It's about believing you can get better at things, right?

JAMES: That's a great start, Tyler. You're on the right track. So let me break it down for everyone. A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities — things like intelligence, talent, skills — are not fixed. They're not set in stone from the day you're born. Instead, they can be developed through dedication, hard work, and learning. The opposite of that is what we call a fixed mindset, which is the belief that you're either naturally good at something or you're not, and there's nothing you can do about it.

FRANCINE: So like when someone says, "I'm just not a math person"?

JAMES: Exactly, Francine. That's a perfect example of a fixed mindset. When someone says, "I'm just not a math person," they're basically saying their ability in math is locked — it can't change. But research has shown that's not true. The brain is a muscle. The more you use it, the more you exercise it in a particular area, the stronger it gets. Just like if you go to the gym and lift weights, your muscles grow. Your brain works in a similar way. When you practice something difficult, your brain actually forms new connections and gets better at processing that kind of information.

FRANK: Wait, the brain is literally a muscle?

JAMES: Good question, Frank. Not literally in the biological sense — the brain is an organ. But we use that phrase, "the brain is a muscle," to help us understand that it responds to exercise and effort the same way a muscle does. When you challenge yourself, when you struggle with something hard, your brain is actually growing. Neuroscientists have found that the connections between neurons — the cells in your brain — get stronger and more efficient the more you practice something. So the struggle is actually the growth happening.

OMONDI: That's interesting. But honestly, some people are just naturally smart. Like, you see some students in class — they don't even study and they get A's. How do you explain that?

JAMES: That's a really thoughtful point, Omondi, and I think a lot of people feel the same way. It can be really frustrating when it seems like things come easily to others. Here's what I'd say — yes, people have different starting points. Some people might pick up certain things faster than others. But that starting point doesn't determine how far you can go. What determines how far you go is effort, practice, and the willingness to keep going even when it's hard. Effort matters more than talent in the long run. There's actually research on this. Students who believe their intelligence can grow end up outperforming students who believe they're just "naturally smart," especially when things get difficult. Because the students with a growth mindset don't give up — they see the difficulty as part of the process.

MAXINE: I don't know. Sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try, I just can't get certain things right. Like, I revised so much for my biology exam last term and I still didn't do well. It made me feel like maybe I'm just not cut out for it.

JAMES: Maxine, thank you for sharing that. It sounds like that was really hard for you — putting in all that effort and not seeing the result you wanted. That's genuinely frustrating, and your feelings about it are completely valid. Can I ask you something, though?

MAXINE: Sure.

JAMES: When you revised, what was your approach? Like, how did you study?

MAXINE: I just read through my notes over and over. Sometimes I'd highlight things.

JAMES: Okay. So here's something interesting about growth mindset — it's not just about working hard. It's about working smart too. Sometimes we put in a lot of effort, but the strategy we're using isn't effective. Re-reading notes, for example, feels productive, but research shows it's one of the least effective ways to study. Things like testing yourself, explaining concepts out loud, or teaching someone else are much more effective. So a growth mindset would say: "I didn't do well, but that doesn't mean I can't do biology. It means I need to find a better strategy."

MAXINE: Hmm. I never thought about it that way.

FRANCINE: That's actually true. My sister used to make me quiz her before her exams, and she always did well. I thought she was just smart, but maybe it was because she was actually using a good strategy.

JAMES: That's a great observation, Francine. And notice what happened there? You initially attributed her success to natural smartness — that's a fixed mindset interpretation. But now you're seeing it might have been the strategy — that's a growth mindset way of looking at it. The way we interpret success and failure really matters.

[00:10]

JAMES: So let me give you all a real example that I think might resonate. When I was in Form Three, I was really struggling with chemistry. I mean, badly. I got a D in my mid-term exam. And I remember thinking, "Chemistry is just not for me. Some people get it, I don't." I had a completely fixed mindset about it. But then my teacher, Mr. Kamau, said something that stuck with me. He said, "James, you're not bad at chemistry. You just haven't figured out how to learn it yet." That one sentence changed everything for me.

PERRY: So what did you do?

JAMES: I started approaching it differently. Instead of just memorizing equations, I started trying to understand why the reactions happen. I formed a small study group with two classmates. We would explain concepts to each other. If I didn't understand something, instead of saying "I can't do this," I started saying "I can't do this yet." That word — "yet" — is actually one of the most powerful words in a growth mindset. It means you're on a journey. You're not there, but you're on your way.

TYLER: And did you end up getting better at chemistry?

JAMES: By the end of the year, I got a B+. Not because I suddenly became a genius. But because I changed my approach, I asked for help, and I kept going even when it was frustrating. That's what learning from failure looks like. The D wasn't the end of the story — it was the beginning of a new strategy.

FRANK: That's actually motivating. But it's hard to think like that in the moment, you know? Like when you fail, you don't think "Oh, great, a learning opportunity." You just feel bad.

JAMES: Frank, you're absolutely right. And I want to acknowledge that. Having a growth mindset doesn't mean you pretend failure doesn't hurt. It does hurt. It's okay to feel disappointed, frustrated, even embarrassed. Those feelings are natural and very human. The growth mindset part is what happens next — after you feel those feelings. Do you stay stuck in "I'm a failure," or do you eventually move to "What can I learn from this?" It's not about ignoring the pain. It's about not letting the pain have the final word.

OMONDI: I think my problem is that I compare myself too much. Like, I see my classmates doing well and I think something is wrong with me. Especially in math. My friend Wanjiku gets everything so fast and I'm always the last one to finish.

JAMES: Omondi, it sounds like that comparison really weighs on you. And I get it — when you're sitting in class and everyone around you seems to get it, it can feel really isolating. But can I share something? Comparison is one of the biggest enemies of a growth mindset. Because when you compare yourself to Wanjiku, you're comparing your chapter three to her chapter ten. You don't know how much she practiced before, what her background is, or what she struggles with in other areas. Your only fair comparison is you today versus you yesterday.

PERRY: That's deep. You today versus you yesterday.

JAMES: Right. And that's actually a really practical way to apply growth mindset. Instead of asking "Am I as good as so-and-so?" ask yourself "Am I better than I was last week? Last month?" If the answer is yes, even a little bit, then you're growing. And that's all that matters.

FRANCINE: I like that. But I have a question. What about when people around you have a fixed mindset? Like, my parents sometimes say things like "You're not like your brother, he was always the academic one." That really hurts and it makes it hard to believe I can improve.

JAMES: Francine, thank you for being so open about that. It sounds like those words carry a lot of weight, and I can understand why they would make it hard to believe in your own growth. It's really tough when the people closest to you seem to be putting a ceiling on what you can achieve. Here's what I want you to know — other people's beliefs about you don't have to become your beliefs about yourself. It's hard, yes. But you get to decide what you believe about your potential. And sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is prove the narrative wrong — not for them, but for yourself.

MAXINE: That's real. My aunt always says I'm the "shy one" in the family, so I should just accept it. But I actually want to be more confident. Am I not allowed to change?

JAMES: Of course you're allowed to change, Maxine. And the fact that you want to — that desire itself is a sign of a growth mindset. Labels that people put on us can feel permanent, but they don't have to be. You're not a finished product. None of us are. You're still becoming. Getting more confident is a skill, and like any skill, you can develop it with practice. Maybe it starts small — speaking up once in a group setting, like you just did right now.

MAXINE: I didn't even realize I was doing that.

JAMES: Exactly. And that's growth happening in real time. Everyone, can we give Maxine a round of appreciation for sharing so openly?

FRANK: Yes! Well said, Maxine.

TYLER: For real.

PERRY: Respect.

[00:20]

JAMES: So I want to do a small exercise with you all. I want each of you to think of one area in your life where you've had a fixed mindset — where you've told yourself "I just can't do this" or "This isn't for me." Then I want you to reframe it with a growth mindset statement. Who wants to go first?

TYLER: I'll go. I always tell myself I'm bad at writing essays. Like, I can talk about ideas all day, but when I sit down to write, my mind goes blank. I guess the growth mindset version would be... "I haven't found my writing process yet."

JAMES: Excellent, Tyler. I love that reframe. "I haven't found my writing process yet." And notice how that opens up possibilities — maybe you need to start by talking your ideas out loud and then writing them down, or maybe you need a different kind of outline. The growth mindset opens doors that the fixed mindset closes. Who's next?

FRANK: Mine is sports. I stopped playing football because I was always on the bench. I told myself I'm just not athletic. But maybe — maybe I just need to train more deliberately?

JAMES: That's a really honest reflection, Frank. And yes, "train more deliberately" is exactly the kind of thinking that a growth mindset leads to. Instead of "I'm not athletic," it becomes "I haven't trained enough in the right way." It doesn't guarantee you'll become a professional footballer, but it gives you agency. You're back in the driver's seat. Perry, would you like to share?

PERRY: Um, okay. For me it's public speaking. I literally freeze. My heart races, I start sweating, and I forget everything. I've always thought I'm just an anxious person and that's who I am.

JAMES: Perry, it sounds like public speaking really triggers a lot of anxiety for you, and that experience of freezing up is genuinely uncomfortable. I appreciate you sharing that. How might you reframe that with what we've been discussing?

PERRY: I guess... "I get anxious about public speaking, but I can learn ways to manage it"?

JAMES: That's a beautiful reframe. Notice you're not denying the anxiety — you're acknowledging it, which is healthy. But you're also saying it doesn't have to control you forever. You can learn techniques. You can practice in safe spaces. Growth mindset doesn't mean pretending the challenge isn't there. It means believing you can work through it. Francine, how about you?

FRANCINE: Mine is cooking, actually. My mum is an amazing cook and I burn everything. I always say "I didn't get the cooking gene." But I guess there's no cooking gene, is there? I just haven't practiced enough.

JAMES: Ha, no, there's no cooking gene! That's a fun example, Francine, and it's actually a really clear illustration. Your mum has probably been cooking for twenty or thirty years. She has thousands of hours of practice. Comparing your chapter one to her chapter thirty isn't fair to you. You could absolutely learn to cook well with practice and patience.

FRANCINE: Maybe I should start with something simple, like eggs.

TYLER: Yes, start with eggs! Everyone can make eggs.

FRANK: Bro, I've burned eggs before.

JAMES: And that's okay! Burning eggs is just data. It tells you the heat was too high or you left it too long. Learning from failure — even in cooking — is part of the process. Omondi, what about you?

OMONDI: Mine is more personal, I think. I always tell myself I'm not good at making friends. Like, it takes me a long time to open up to people, and by the time I'm comfortable, everyone already has their friend groups. I guess the reframe would be... "Building friendships takes me time, but that doesn't mean I can't build deep ones."

JAMES: Omondi, that was a really thoughtful and vulnerable share. Thank you. And your reframe is spot on. Some people connect quickly and on a surface level; others take time but build really deep, meaningful friendships. There's nothing wrong with your pace. The growth mindset here is understanding that social skills are still skills — they can be developed. And honestly, you've been contributing so well to this group today. That's connection happening.

OMONDI: Thanks, James.

JAMES: Maxine, would you like to share yours? No pressure at all.

MAXINE: No, I want to. Mine is actually about confidence, like I mentioned before. I always say, "I'm too shy to lead anything." But maybe the growth mindset version is "I'm learning to step into leadership, and it's okay to start small."

JAMES: I love that, Maxine. "It's okay to start small." That's such an important part of growth mindset. You don't have to go from shy to giving a TED talk overnight. You can start by leading a small group discussion, or volunteering for a small role in a project. Every small step builds the muscle — and remember, the brain is a muscle. Each time you practice stepping out of your comfort zone, it gets a little easier because your brain is forming those new pathways.

[00:30]

JAMES: Great work, everyone. I'm really impressed by how honest and thoughtful you've all been. Now I want us to go a little deeper. Let's talk about how we respond to setbacks, because that's where growth mindset really gets tested. Can anyone think of a time when they faced a setback and how they responded?

TYLER: I got dropped from the debate team last year. I had done well in the first round, but then in the second round I completely choked. I forgot my arguments, I stumbled over my words. The teacher said I wasn't ready for the next level. Honestly, I wanted to quit everything.

JAMES: Tyler, that must have been really painful. Being told you're "not ready" after you'd put yourself out there — that takes a toll. What did you end up doing?

TYLER: At first, I just stopped going to debate practice entirely. I was angry and embarrassed. But then a friend in the club told me that even the best debaters lose rounds. She said the top debaters in Kenya practice way more than people realize. So I eventually went back, and I started recording myself practicing at home so I could hear where I got weak.

JAMES: And how did that work out?

TYLER: I actually made the team again this year. And I placed third in the county round.

JAMES: That is an incredible example, Tyler. Thank you for sharing it. Everyone, can you see what happened there? Tyler faced a failure — getting dropped from the team. He felt terrible, which is natural. But eventually, he came back with a new strategy — recording himself — and he improved significantly. That's learning from failure in action. The failure wasn't the end. It became the fuel.

FRANK: That's impressive, Tyler. I didn't know you were on the debate team.

TYLER: Yeah, I don't really talk about it much.

JAMES: Sometimes we hide our growth because we don't want people to know about the struggle that came before it. But the struggle is actually the most impressive part. Perry, you had your hand up?

PERRY: Yeah, I was going to say — Tyler's story reminds me of something that happened with me, but I didn't handle it as well. I failed my driving test twice. After the second time, I just gave up. I told myself I'll never learn to drive. It's been a year and I still haven't gone back.

JAMES: Perry, it sounds like those failures were really discouraging, and I understand why you felt like stepping away. Two attempts can feel like a pattern, like the universe is telling you something. But with what we've talked about today, how might you look at that situation differently now?

PERRY: I guess maybe I need to figure out what specifically I was doing wrong. Like, I know I was really nervous during the test, and I kept making mistakes on the roundabout. So maybe I just need to practice roundabouts more and find a way to deal with the nerves.

JAMES: That's exactly it. See how you shifted from "I'll never learn to drive" — a fixed mindset — to "I need to practice specific skills and manage my nerves" — a growth mindset? That's a completely different story, and it's one that actually has a path forward. Would you go back and try again?

PERRY: Maybe. Actually, yeah. I think I want to. Now I feel like maybe fighting it was the right move all along.

JAMES: And listen, nobody is saying it won't be hard. A growth mindset doesn't make things easy — it makes things possible. There's a big difference.

FRANCINE: I have a story, but it's not about school. Is that okay?

JAMES: Of course. Growth mindset applies to every area of life.

FRANCINE: Okay. So, I tried to start a small side business last year — selling handmade bracelets online. I spent weeks making them, took nice photos, set up an Instagram page. And then... nothing. No one bought anything. I got maybe three likes on each post. I felt so stupid. I took the page down after two weeks.

JAMES: Francine, first of all, the fact that you took the initiative to start something at your age is remarkable. That takes courage. It sounds like you felt really let down when the response wasn't what you expected, and that's completely understandable. What do you think now, looking back?

FRANCINE: I think maybe I gave up too fast. Two weeks is not really enough time. And I didn't really know anything about marketing or social media growth. I just thought if I made nice things, people would find them.

JAMES: That's a really mature reflection. And it shows growth mindset thinking. You're not saying "I'm not a business person." You're saying "I didn't have the right strategy or knowledge yet." That "yet" again. Do you think you'd try again?

FRANCINE: I've actually been thinking about it. Maybe with a different approach. Like learning about social media marketing first, or starting with selling to friends and family.

JAMES: I think that could be amazing. And notice — the first attempt wasn't a waste. It was research. You learned what doesn't work, and now you can apply that knowledge. That's exactly what learning from failure is all about.

[00:40]

JAMES: We've covered a lot of ground today, and I want to start wrapping up. But before I do, I want to summarize what we've talked about and then hear from each of you on one takeaway. So, today we explored growth mindset — the belief that your abilities can be developed through effort, strategy, and persistence. We talked about how the brain is a muscle — it gets stronger when you challenge it. We talked about how effort matters more than talent, and how learning from failure is one of the most powerful ways to grow. We explored how comparison can be the enemy of growth and how even the labels other people put on us don't define our potential. We practiced reframing fixed mindset statements into growth mindset ones. And we heard some really powerful personal stories from all of you.

JAMES: Now, I want to go around and hear one thing that's sticking with you from today. It can be anything — a phrase, a thought, a realization. Let's start with Frank.

FRANK: For me it's the idea that the struggle is where the growth happens. I always thought struggling meant I was bad at something, but now I see it differently. Like, the struggle is the exercise. It's the mental gym session.

JAMES: I love that metaphor, Frank. The mental gym session. That's powerful.

FRANCINE: Mine is "you today versus you yesterday." I feel like I'm always comparing myself to my brother or my classmates, and it never feels good. But comparing myself to who I was last week — that's actually motivating.

JAMES: That's a really healthy shift in perspective, Francine. I'm glad that resonated with you.

TYLER: For me, it's that failure isn't the end of the story. Like, my debate experience taught me that, but I never had the language for it. Now I know — it's growth mindset. Failure is data, not a verdict.

JAMES: "Failure is data, not a verdict." Tyler, you should put that on a poster. That's really well said.

MAXINE: My takeaway is that it's okay to start small. I always feel like if I can't do something perfectly, there's no point in trying. But maybe I can just... start. Even if it's messy. Even if it's small.

JAMES: Absolutely, Maxine. Starting small is still starting. And messy progress is still progress. I'm really proud of how you've shown up today.

PERRY: For me, I think the biggest thing is that a growth mindset doesn't mean pretending things are easy. It means believing I can work through hard things. I'm actually thinking about going back for my driving test now.

JAMES: Perry, that makes me so happy to hear. And you're right — growth mindset isn't about toxic positivity. It's about realistic optimism. You acknowledge the challenge, and then you face it with the belief that you can grow. Omondi, how about you?

OMONDI: I've been thinking about what you said about comparison. And also about the word "yet." I'm going to start using that. Like, I'm not good at this... yet. It sounds small, but it feels different when you add that word.

JAMES: It's not small at all, Omondi. That single word changes the entire meaning of the sentence. It changes a dead end into a path. I'm really glad that stuck with you.

JAMES: I also want to leave you all with a small challenge for this week. I'd like each of you to notice one moment where you catch yourself thinking with a fixed mindset — maybe something like "I can't do this" or "I'm just not good at that" — and try to reframe it. Add the word "yet." Ask yourself what strategy you could try. You don't have to share it with anyone, but if you want to talk about it next time, I'd love to hear about it.

TYLER: Can I share it in our WhatsApp group?

JAMES: Sure, if you're comfortable! That could actually be a great way to encourage each other throughout the week.

FRANK: I'm in for that.

FRANCINE: Same.

[00:50]

JAMES: Alright, everyone. Thank you so much for being here today and for being so open. This was a really special session. You all shared personal things, you supported each other, and you showed real courage. I want you to remember — every one of you is capable of growth. Not because I'm saying it, but because that's what the science shows. Your brain is constantly changing, constantly capable of learning and adapting. You just have to keep showing up and keep trying, even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.

OMONDI: Thanks, James. This was actually really helpful.

MAXINE: Yeah, I liked this session.

PERRY: Same. See you all next week.

JAMES: See you next week, everyone. Take care of yourselves. And remember — you're not a finished product. You're still becoming.

END OF SESSION
