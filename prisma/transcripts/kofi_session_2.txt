SALLY: Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome, welcome. It's so good to see all your faces. Before we dive in, I want to start with our usual check-in. But today, instead of one word, I want you to share one good thing that happened this week, no matter how small. It can be tiny. Who wants to go first?

NJERI: I'll start. I made a really good cup of chai this morning. Like, it was perfect — the ratio of milk to tea was just right. It sounds silly but it genuinely made my day.

SALLY: That's not silly at all, Njeri! A perfect cup of chai is one of life's great pleasures. I love that you noticed it. Ochieng?

OCHIENG: I helped my younger brother with his homework yesterday and he actually understood it for once. He was so happy. That felt good.

SALLY: That's wonderful. Being able to teach someone something — that's a real skill, Ochieng. Fatima?

FATIMA: My neighbour gave us some pilau she made and it was so delicious. I've been thinking about it all day honestly.

SALLY: Ha! Good food stays in your memory. I love that. Dennis?

DENNIS: I managed to wake up early three days this week. That's a big deal for me because I'm usually the last person up.

SALLY: Three days! That's a streak. That takes real discipline. How did it feel?

DENNIS: Amazing actually. I had time to eat breakfast properly and I wasn't rushing to school. I felt more calm the whole day.

SALLY: I love hearing that. Grace, what about you?

GRACE: My mum told me she was proud of me. She doesn't say that very often, so it really hit different.

SALLY: Grace, that's really special. I can see it still means a lot to you even talking about it now. That's beautiful. Kofi?

KOFI: I scored a goal in our lunchtime football match. I'm usually the defender but I went up for a corner and headed it in. The guys went crazy.

SALLY: A header! That's amazing, Kofi! And as a defender, that must have felt extra special. Okay, I love all of these. And what I want you to notice is that each of these good things you shared connects to something you're good at. Njeri noticed the details in her chai — that's attentiveness. Ochieng taught his brother — that's patience and communication. Fatima appreciated her neighbour — that's warmth. Dennis built discipline. Grace values connection. And Kofi stepped outside his usual role and succeeded. These aren't random things. They're clues to your strengths.

NJERI: I never would have connected making chai to a personal strength.

SALLY: And that's exactly what we're going to talk about today. Today's topic is Identifying Personal Strengths. We all have strengths — things we're naturally drawn to, things that energize us, things other people notice about us. But most of us spend way more time thinking about our weaknesses than our strengths. Today we're going to flip that.

[00:10]

SALLY: So let me start with a question. What is a strength? When I say "personal strength," what comes to mind?

DENNIS: Something you're good at?

OCHIENG: Talents. Like being good at sports or music.

GRACE: Being smart?

SALLY: These are all reasonable answers. But I want to expand how we think about strengths, because I think we often have a narrow definition. We tend to think strengths are only impressive talents — like being a great singer or an amazing athlete or getting straight A's. But strengths are much broader than that. A strength can be something like loyalty, kindness, persistence, curiosity, humour, honesty, or creativity. It can be the ability to stay calm in a crisis, or the ability to make people laugh, or the ability to listen deeply. These are character strengths, and they matter just as much as any talent or skill.

FATIMA: I never thought of kindness as a strength. I always thought of it as just... being a nice person.

SALLY: And that's the thing, Fatima. We often undervalue the strengths we have because they come naturally to us. We think, "Oh, that's just who I am, it's nothing special." But it is special. Not everyone is kind. Not everyone is patient. Not everyone can make others feel comfortable. If it comes naturally to you, that's your strength — and it's valuable. Can I share something personal with you all?

KOFI: Yeah, go ahead.

SALLY: When I was in secondary school, I was not the top student. I wasn't the best at sports. I couldn't sing. I didn't have any of the obvious "talents" that got people noticed. And I spent years feeling like I didn't have any strengths. Zero. I genuinely believed I was just average at everything. But then one day, my friend told me something that changed my perspective. She said, "Sally, you know what's special about you? Every time someone in our group is upset, you're the first person to notice. You always know what to say to make people feel better." And I remember thinking — that's a strength? But it is. The ability to notice when someone is hurting and respond with empathy — that's emotional intelligence. And it's one of the most important strengths a person can have.

GRACE: I feel like that's me too. I'm always the friend people come to when they're upset. But I never thought of it as a strength. I just thought it meant I attract drama.

SALLY: Grace, that's such an important reframe. You don't attract drama — you attract trust. People come to you because they feel safe with you. That's not a burden, that's a gift. Now, I want to be careful here — it is important to protect your own energy and not take on everyone else's problems. But the core ability? That's a real, meaningful strength.

NJERI: Sally, can I ask something? What if you genuinely don't know what your strengths are? Like, I can tell other people what they're good at, but when it comes to myself, I draw a blank.

SALLY: That is such a great question, Njeri, and honestly, it's probably the most common experience. Most people find it easier to identify their weaknesses than their strengths. There are a few reasons for that — we're wired to focus on threats and problems, our culture often discourages us from "boasting," and we tend to take our strengths for granted because they feel easy to us. Here's one exercise that can help: ask three people who know you well — a friend, a family member, and maybe a teacher — "What do you think I'm good at?" You might be surprised by their answers.

FATIMA: That would be so awkward though. Imagine texting your friend, "Hey, what am I good at?"

SALLY: Ha! It might feel awkward, but try it. You could frame it as something you're doing for a school project or this group. And I promise you, the answers will be eye-opening. People see our strengths way more clearly than we do, because they're looking from the outside. Shall we try something similar right now?

OCHIENG: What do you mean?

SALLY: Let's try a strengths spotlight. I'll pick someone, and then the rest of the group will share one strength they see in that person. The person just listens — no deflecting, no arguing, just receive it. How does that sound?

DENNIS: That sounds intense. But I'm in.

[00:20]

SALLY: Okay, let's start with Kofi. Everyone, tell Kofi one strength you see in him.

OCHIENG: Kofi is tough. Like, not in an aggressive way, but he's resilient. He doesn't let things knock him down easily.

FATIMA: I think Kofi is really genuine. Like, he doesn't pretend to be something he's not. What you see is what you get, and that's refreshing.

GRACE: He's loyal. When Kofi is your friend, he's really your friend. I've seen him stand up for people even when it wasn't popular.

NJERI: I'd say he's brave. He tries things even when he might fail. Like the header in football — most defenders wouldn't even go up for that.

DENNIS: Kofi's funny. He makes the group lighter. When things get tense, he always has something that eases the mood.

SALLY: And I'd add that Kofi has natural leadership qualities. He might not see himself as a leader, but people look to him. Kofi, how does it feel to hear all that?

KOFI: Honestly? Weird. But good weird. I didn't know people noticed those things. Like, I thought I was just... there. Just vibing. I didn't think anyone was thinking "Oh, Kofi is brave" or "Kofi is loyal."

SALLY: And that's exactly the point I'm making. We can't see our own strengths clearly because they feel normal to us. But others can see them. This is why it's so important to hear from people around you. Okay, let's do Njeri next.

KOFI: Njeri is observant. She notices things other people miss. Like, she'll remember what you said two weeks ago and bring it up in the perfect moment.

GRACE: She's thoughtful. Njeri is the type of person who actually thinks before she speaks, and when she does say something, it's always meaningful.

OCHIENG: She's creative. The way she describes things, even like the chai this morning — she sees beauty in everyday stuff.

FATIMA: I think Njeri is quietly strong. She doesn't make a big show of it, but she handles things with grace. She's tough on the inside.

DENNIS: She's a good listener. Like, when you talk to Njeri, you feel like she's actually hearing you, not just waiting for her turn to talk.

SALLY: And I'd add that Njeri has a depth of character that's rare at any age. You think deeply about the world, and that's a real strength. Njeri, how does that feel?

NJERI: I... wow. Okay, I might cry. I really didn't expect all of that. Quietly strong? I always feel like I'm falling apart on the inside. Hearing that other people see strength when I feel weak... that's kind of overwhelming. In a good way.

SALLY: Njeri, it sounds like there's a big gap between how you see yourself and how others see you. And that's really common. We see our struggles from the inside — every doubt, every moment of weakness. But people around us see the finished product — how we show up, how we carry ourselves, how we treat others. Both perspectives are real, but I want you to give as much weight to the outside view as you give to the inside one. Can you try to do that?

NJERI: I'll try. Thank you, everyone. Seriously.

[00:30]

SALLY: Let's keep going. Fatima, your turn to receive.

NJERI: Fatima is warm. She makes everyone feel welcome. I remember my first day in this group — I was so nervous, and Fatima came up to me and started chatting like we'd known each other forever. It made everything easier.

OCHIENG: She's generous. Not just with stuff, but with her time and attention. If you need help, Fatima's there.

KOFI: Fatima is brave in a quiet way. She shares personal things honestly. That takes courage.

GRACE: I'd say she's positive. Like, she always finds something good in a situation. The pilau from her neighbour earlier — most people wouldn't have even mentioned that. But Fatima noticed and appreciated it.

DENNIS: She's emotionally intelligent. She reads the room really well. She can tell when someone is off and she'll check in.

SALLY: And I see enormous compassion in you, Fatima. You feel for other people deeply, and that makes you someone people want to be around. How does that land for you?

FATIMA: It's really nice to hear. Especially the warm part. My mum always tells me I'm too friendly with people and I need to be more careful. So I sometimes feel like being warm is a weakness because people might take advantage of me. But hearing you all say it's a strength... that feels different.

SALLY: Fatima, that's a really important distinction. Your mum's concern probably comes from a place of wanting to protect you, and being discerning about who you trust is wise. But the warmth itself? That's gold. It's not about being less warm — it's about directing that warmth wisely. Both can be true.

SALLY: Okay, we have a few more people and I want to make sure everyone gets a turn. Let's do Ochieng, Dennis, and Grace. We'll be a bit quicker but just as meaningful. Ochieng — everyone, go.

FATIMA: Ochieng is responsible. Like, he took time to help his brother. That shows he takes things seriously.

GRACE: He's patient. Teaching someone takes so much patience, and Ochieng did it until his brother understood.

KOFI: Ochieng is humble. He's one of those people who is better than he thinks he is.

NJERI: He's steady. Like, in a group, Ochieng is the calm one. You know he's not going to overreact to anything.

DENNIS: He's dependable. If Ochieng says he'll do something, he'll do it.

SALLY: I see quiet wisdom in you, Ochieng. You observe and process before you act. That's a rare and underrated strength. How does that sit with you?

OCHIENG: It's nice. I always saw being quiet as a negative thing, like I should talk more. But hearing that people see it as steadiness and wisdom... that's encouraging.

SALLY: Being quiet isn't a flaw. It's a different kind of strength. Not every leader is the loudest voice in the room. Some of the most impactful leaders are the ones who listen more than they speak. Alright, Dennis!

OCHIENG: Dennis is disciplined. He woke up early three days this week — that's not nothing. That takes real willpower.

NJERI: He's honest. Dennis doesn't sugarcoat things. You always know where you stand with him.

FATIMA: He's ambitious. Like, you can tell Dennis wants to grow. He sets goals for himself.

KOFI: He's got energy. Dennis lifts the room. When he's in a good mood, everyone's in a good mood.

GRACE: He's self-aware. He knows his weaknesses and he actually tries to work on them. That's rare.

SALLY: And I see determination in you, Dennis. The discipline to change a habit — like waking up early — shows that when you decide to do something, you commit. That's a powerful strength.

DENNIS: Thanks. Honestly, I usually focus on all the things I'm bad at. It's nice to hear the other side.

SALLY: That's so common, Dennis. But I want you to remember what you heard today. These aren't just nice words — people gave you real, specific examples. That means they're real.

[00:40]

SALLY: And last but absolutely not least — Grace.

DENNIS: Grace is compassionate. She's always checking on people. She sends you a text if she thinks you're having a rough day.

NJERI: She's wise. Grace gives really good advice. Not the kind that's preachy — the kind that actually helps because she's listening to what you need.

OCHIENG: She's emotionally strong. I've seen Grace go through a lot and she comes out of it. She doesn't let things break her.

FATIMA: Grace is inclusive. She's the one who makes sure nobody's left out. Like in groups, she'll always pull people in.

KOFI: She's real. Grace doesn't fake it. If she doesn't like something, she says it. If she cares about you, you know it. There's no guessing with her.

SALLY: And I see a deep well of empathy in you, Grace. You have the ability to hold space for others without losing yourself. That's one of the most important strengths a person can have, especially at your age. Grace?

GRACE: I don't even know what to say. Thank you. I think... I forget sometimes that people see these things. Because from my side, I just feel like I'm barely keeping it together. But knowing that you all see strength where I see struggle — that means everything. I needed this today.

SALLY: Grace, what you just said is so powerful. "People see strength where I see struggle." I think that's true for all of us. We're always closer to our own pain, our own doubt. But strength isn't the absence of struggle. It's what you do in the middle of it. And from where this group sits, you're doing a lot right. Everyone, can we give Grace some appreciation?

KOFI: Well deserved.

FATIMA: Love you, Grace.

NJERI: For real.

SALLY: Okay, so what we did today — the strengths spotlight — I want you to take this with you. Not just as a nice memory, but as a practice. Start noticing your strengths in daily life. When something goes well, instead of thinking "I got lucky," ask yourself "What strength did I use there?" Was it patience? Creativity? Persistence? Empathy? Start naming them. The more you recognize your strengths, the more you can deliberately use them.

OCHIENG: That's a really practical way to think about it. Instead of "I got lucky," ask what strength you used.

SALLY: Exactly. It's a mindset shift. And over time, you'll find that you have more strengths than you ever imagined. They were always there — you just weren't looking for them.

[00:50]

SALLY: Alright, let's wrap up. I want to go around one final time. Give me one strength you're going to pay more attention to this week. Something about yourself that you want to start owning.

NJERI: I want to own being thoughtful. I always saw it as me being too slow or too quiet. But if people see it as depth and thoughtfulness, then I want to lean into that instead of apologizing for it.

OCHIENG: I want to own being steady. I'm going to stop seeing my quietness as a problem and start seeing it as an anchor for the people around me.

FATIMA: I want to own my warmth. I'm going to stop worrying that it makes me vulnerable and start seeing it as the strength it is.

DENNIS: Discipline. I proved to myself this week that I can build a new habit. I want to keep that going and apply it to other areas.

GRACE: I want to own my empathy. But I also want to work on giving some of that empathy to myself, not just others.

SALLY: Grace, that's incredibly wise. Empathy for yourself is just as important as empathy for others. And recognizing that is a huge step.

KOFI: I want to own being genuine. I've always just been myself because I didn't know how to be anything else. But hearing everyone say that's a strength? That makes me want to protect that. Keep being real even when it's easier to pretend.

SALLY: Kofi, that's beautiful. Authenticity is rare and it's valuable. Don't ever let anyone make you feel like being real is a weakness. Alright, everyone. You all showed up today in such a powerful way. You were vulnerable, you were generous, you supported each other. That's not easy, and it takes real courage. I want you to remember what you heard today. Write it down if you need to. These strengths are yours — they're real, and they matter. I'll see you all next week. Take care of yourselves.

NJERI: Thanks, Sally. This was probably my favourite session so far.

GRACE: Same. I really needed this.

KOFI: See you next week, everyone.

SALLY: Bye, everyone!
