VICTOR: Okay, so, welcome everyone. Today we're going to talk about goal setting. Basically, you know, how to set goals and achieve them. It's pretty straightforward. So, who here has goals? Like, things you want to accomplish?

CYNTHIA: Of course. Everyone has goals.

VICTOR: Right, exactly. So goals are important because if you don't know where you're going, you'll end up nowhere. That's what they say, right? So the first thing about goals is they should be, like, specific. Don't just say "I want to do well in school." Say "I want to get a B+ in math." See the difference? One is vague, one is clear. Okay, so let's hear some goals. What are your goals? Abdi, go.

ABDI: I want to get into a good university.

VICTOR: Cool. That's a good goal. Make it more specific though. Which university? What course?

ABDI: University of Nairobi. Medicine.

VICTOR: Medicine! That's ambitious. Okay. So you need to be getting really good grades for that. Are you getting good grades right now?

ABDI: Some subjects are good, others not so much. Chemistry is killing me.

VICTOR: Then you need to focus on chemistry. That's your priority. Get a tutor or something. Nekesa, what about you?

NEKESA: I want to start my own business one day. Something in fashion.

VICTOR: Fashion. Okay. That's cool. But that's long-term. What's a short-term goal that would get you there?

NEKESA: Maybe learning to sew? I've been wanting to take a tailoring class.

VICTOR: There you go. See, that's more actionable. You can't start a fashion business if you don't know how to sew. Well, I guess some people do, but, you know, having the skill helps. Jamal?

JAMAL: I want to move out of my neighbourhood. I don't like where I live. There's too much going on — noise, drama, bad influences. I want to get somewhere quieter where I can focus.

VICTOR: That's more of a life goal but yeah, sure. For that you need money, so the goal should probably be about making money or getting a good job that lets you afford a different place. Focus on the steps.

CYNTHIA: Can I go next?

VICTOR: Sure.

CYNTHIA: I want to lose weight.

VICTOR: Okay, so how much? And by when?

CYNTHIA: I don't know. I just feel unhealthy. I get tired easily and I don't like how I look.

VICTOR: Well, you should probably set a specific target. Like "I want to lose ten kilos in three months" or something. And then break it down — exercise, diet, that kind of thing.

PAULINE: That feels kind of harsh. She said she doesn't feel healthy, and you went straight to kilos and timelines.

VICTOR: I'm just trying to make it specific. That's what goal setting is about. But yeah, okay, Cynthia, the main thing is just feeling healthier, right? So maybe the goal is "exercise three times a week" or "eat more vegetables." Something you can measure.

CYNTHIA: Yeah. I think the exercise one is more realistic for me.

VICTOR: Cool. Pauline, what's your goal?

PAULINE: I want to repair my relationship with my dad. We don't talk much. There's a lot of unspoken stuff between us from when my parents divorced. I want to try to fix that.

VICTOR: That's a tough one. Relationship goals are hard to measure because you can't control the other person. You can only control your side. So maybe your goal is "Have one honest conversation with my dad per month." That's measurable and it's on your side.

PAULINE: I guess. But it's not really about frequency. It's about depth. One conversation that's real is better than ten surface-level ones.

VICTOR: Yeah, true. Okay, so maybe the goal is "Initiate one meaningful conversation with my dad." And see where it goes from there. Cliff, you're the last one. What's your goal?

CLIFF: I want to be happier.

VICTOR: Hmm, that's really vague. What would make you happier?

CLIFF: I don't know, man. If I knew, I wouldn't need a goal.

VICTOR: Fair enough. Let me ask it differently — what makes you unhappy right now?

CLIFF: School. I hate school. I don't see the point of most of it. Like, when am I ever going to use trigonometry?

VICTOR: I mean, trig is useful in engineering and architecture and stuff. But I get your point. If you're not interested in those fields, it can feel irrelevant. But school is about more than the subjects — it's about proving you can work hard, which universities and employers look at.

CLIFF: That's what teachers always say. "You need it for your future." But what if my future doesn't require trigonometry?

VICTOR: Then you still need the grade to get to the future you want. Look, school isn't perfect, but the system is what it is. You have to play the game. So maybe your goal could be "Find a way to stay motivated in school even when I don't enjoy the subject."

CLIFF: That doesn't feel like a goal. That feels like torture.

VICTOR: Ha, okay. Let me think. Well, what do you enjoy? What subjects or activities do you actually like?

CLIFF: Music. I'm in the school choir and I play guitar. That's the only reason I show up to school some days, honestly.

VICTOR: There you go! So maybe the goal is about pursuing music more seriously. Like, "Learn five new songs on guitar this term" or "Look into music production courses." Turn what you love into a goal.

CLIFF: That I could get behind.

[00:10]

VICTOR: So the thing about goals is there's this framework called SMART goals. Has anyone heard of that? SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. You want your goals to hit each of these. So, Nekesa, your goal of learning to sew is specific and relevant to your bigger dream. If you add a timeline — like "Enrol in a tailoring class by the end of this month" — then it's time-bound too. And it's achievable and measurable. So it's a SMART goal.

NEKESA: That makes sense. I've just been saying "I'll learn one day" for like two years. Maybe putting a deadline on it will actually make me do it.

VICTOR: Exactly. "One day" never comes. You need a date. Okay, so this is something important I should have mentioned earlier probably. The reason goal setting matters for your mental health is that when you have clear goals, you feel more in control of your life. You feel like you're moving forward instead of being stuck. And that sense of progress is really good for your mood and self-esteem. When you don't have goals, you can feel lost, directionless, and that can lead to low mood and anxiety.

JAMAL: That tracks. I feel stuck all the time and I think it's because I don't feel like I'm making progress towards anything.

VICTOR: Right. So setting even one small goal and working towards it can change that. It doesn't have to be a huge goal. Even something like "Read one book this month" gives you direction.

JAMAL: What if you set a goal and then you don't achieve it? Doesn't that make you feel worse?

VICTOR: It can, yeah. But that's why the "Achievable" part of SMART is important. Don't set yourself up to fail by making the goal too big too fast. Start small. And if you don't hit the goal, instead of seeing it as failure, see it as data. What got in the way? Was the goal too ambitious? Did something unexpected happen? You adjust and try again. Goals aren't pass-fail. They're direction.

ABDI: "Goals aren't pass-fail, they're direction." I like that.

PAULINE: Can we talk about something though? What about when your goals conflict with what other people expect from you? Like, Cliff wants to pursue music, but I bet his parents want him to be a doctor or engineer.

CLIFF: A lawyer actually. My dad keeps pushing law.

PAULINE: Right. So how do you set goals that are true to you when the people around you have different plans for your life?

VICTOR: That's... a hard one. I think honestly you have to find a balance. Like, you can pursue music and still do well enough in school to keep your parents happy. It doesn't have to be either-or. Unless you flunk everything and tell your dad you're becoming a rapper. Then you'll have a problem.

CLIFF: I can't rap.

VICTOR: See, problem solved. But seriously, the conversation with your parents is important. Not in a rebellious way, but in a mature way. Show them you're serious about music by actually putting in work, and show them you're not neglecting school. Actions speak louder than words.

NEKESA: My parents are actually supportive of the fashion thing. My mum keeps saying "Just learn something practical first." So I might do a business course and fashion on the side.

VICTOR: Smart. That way you have a backup and you're pursuing your passion. Okay, what about obstacles? What gets in the way of you achieving your goals?

[00:20]

CYNTHIA: Laziness, honestly.

ABDI: Distraction. My phone is my biggest enemy.

JAMAL: My environment. It's hard to focus on goals when there's drama happening around you all the time.

PAULINE: Fear. Fear of failing. Fear of what people will say if I try and don't succeed.

CLIFF: Lack of direction. I have the interest but I don't know the path.

NEKESA: Procrastination. I keep putting things off until the deadline is right there and then I panic.

VICTOR: Okay, these are all super common. Let me go through a few. Cynthia, you said laziness, but I actually don't think laziness is a real thing. I think what we call laziness is usually either lack of motivation, lack of energy, or being overwhelmed. Which one do you think it is for you?

CYNTHIA: Probably lack of motivation. Like, I know I should exercise but I just can't make myself do it.

VICTOR: So the question isn't "How do I stop being lazy?" It's "How do I get motivated?" And the answer usually is: don't wait for motivation. Just start. Motivation comes after action, not before. You don't feel motivated, then exercise. You exercise, then feel motivated to do it again because you felt good after. It's backwards from what we expect.

CYNTHIA: Huh. That's actually helpful.

VICTOR: Abdi, phone distraction — there are apps that lock your phone for set periods. Try one. Set a study timer, lock the phone, study. Release. It's not discipline, it's designing your environment.

ABDI: I've heard of those. Maybe I should actually use one.

VICTOR: Jamal, your environment — that's harder because you can't always change it. But you can find pockets. The school library, a friend's house, even a corner of a matatu. Find where you can focus and use that. It's not ideal, but it's what you have.

JAMAL: Yeah. It's just hard to think about long-term goals when today is already chaos, you know?

VICTOR: I hear you. And honestly, sometimes the goal for the day is just to survive the day. And that's okay. Not every goal has to be a big life thing. "Get through today" is valid. Pauline, fear of failure — the only way through that is exposure. Start small, fail small, realize it doesn't kill you, repeat. The fear gets quieter the more you prove it wrong.

PAULINE: That's easy to say.

VICTOR: You're right, it is. And it's hard to do. But it is the way through. You can also redefine failure. Instead of "failure means I'm not good enough," try "failure means I tried something hard." That changes the whole equation.

CLIFF: For me, the lack of direction — I think I just need to research. Like, I don't even know what careers exist in music besides being a performer. Maybe there are things I haven't thought of.

VICTOR: Absolutely. Music production, sound engineering, music therapy, music education, talent management, event coordination — there's a whole industry beyond the stage. Do some research. Talk to people in the field. YouTube has a million videos about careers in music. The information is there; you just have to look.

[00:30]

VICTOR: Okay, let me try to wrap this up. So, goal setting is basically about giving yourself direction so you're not just floating through life. Use the SMART framework to make your goals clear. Start small — don't try to change everything at once. Identify your obstacles and design strategies around them. And give yourself grace when you fall short. Goals are direction, not judgement. Any questions?

ABDI: No, this was helpful.

NEKESA: I'm actually going to research tailoring classes tonight. For real this time.

VICTOR: Do it, Nekesa. Like, tonight. Don't say "I'll do it this weekend." Tonight.

CLIFF: I'm going to look up music careers. I feel like that could open some doors in my mind.

PAULINE: I'm going to think about the conversation with my dad. Not rush into it, but start thinking about what I want to say.

CYNTHIA: I'm going to try exercising without waiting to feel like it. Just start and see what happens.

JAMAL: I'm going to find my focus spot. Somewhere in my neighbourhood where I can sit and actually think without noise.

VICTOR: These are all solid. I'm happy with how this went. One last thing — write your goals down. Physically. On paper or on your phone. Goals you write down are statistically way more likely to be achieved than goals you just keep in your head. It's like a contract with yourself. Alright, that's it for today. Thanks for coming, everyone. See you next week.

CYNTHIA: Thanks, Victor.

ABDI: See you.

CLIFF: Later.

VICTOR: Later, guys!
