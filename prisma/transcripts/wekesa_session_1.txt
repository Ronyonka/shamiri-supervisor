KEVIN: Hey everyone, welcome. Good to see you all. Let's get started with a quick check-in. How's everyone doing today? Just share however you're feeling.

ADHIAMBO: I'm good. Had a birthday this week so I'm still riding that high.

KEVIN: Happy belated birthday, Adhiambo! That's great. Mutiso?

MUTISO: Doing alright. Nothing special. Just another week.

GLORIA: I'm okay. A bit tired from chores.

NZOMO: I'm fine. Kept busy with school mostly.

BETH: Not great, honestly. But I'm here.

OUMA: I'm alright.

KEVIN: Thanks, everyone. Beth, I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling great. Hopefully today helps a little. So, our topic today is Dealing with Loss and Change. Now, when I say "loss," most people immediately think of death. And yes, death is one kind of loss. But there are many other types of loss that we experience, and they all matter. Loss of a friendship, moving to a new school, a relationship ending, losing a pet, a family member moving away, even losing a routine you liked. Change and loss are connected because every change involves losing something — even if you gain something new. Has anyone here experienced a significant loss or change recently?

ADHIAMBO: I guess technically my best friend moving to another school counts? She transferred to a boarding school in Nakuru at the beginning of the term. We still text but it's not the same.

KEVIN: That absolutely counts, Adhiambo. Losing someone's daily presence is a real loss, even if the person is still alive and you can still communicate. The friendship changes shape, and that requires grieving what it was. What's been the hardest part for you?

ADHIAMBO: Lunchtime. We used to eat together every day and talk about everything. Now I eat alone sometimes or with other people but it's not the same vibe. I didn't realize how much I depended on that until it was gone.

KEVIN: That's a really honest reflection. And it highlights something important — we often don't realize how much someone means to our daily life until they're not there. Routines we take for granted become the things we miss most. Does anyone relate to that?

GLORIA: Kind of. My older sister got married last year and moved out. She's not far — she's still in Nairobi — but she used to be in the next room. We'd stay up talking, sharing clothes, arguing about stupid stuff. Now the room is empty and the house feels different. People say, "But she's still close by!" and they don't get that it's not the same.

KEVIN: Gloria, it sounds like people in your life have been minimizing your loss, and that must be really frustrating. Just because your sister is nearby doesn't mean the loss isn't real. You lost a version of your relationship — the daily intimacy, the spontaneous late-night conversations. That deserves to be grieved, even if she's still in your life.

GLORIA: Thank you for saying that. Everyone acts like I should just be happy for her.

KEVIN: You can be happy for her and sad for yourself at the same time. Those aren't contradictory feelings. Okay, what about others? Mutiso, Nzomo, Beth, Ouma — anyone want to share?

[00:10]

MUTISO: I lost my grandfather about six months ago. He lived with us, so it wasn't like losing someone far away. He was there every morning when I woke up, sitting in his chair, listening to the radio. And then one day he wasn't. And the chair is still there and the radio is still there but he's not. It still doesn't feel real some days.

KEVIN: Mutiso, I'm really sorry for your loss. It sounds like your grandfather was a constant presence in your home, and losing that daily presence — hearing the radio, seeing him in his chair — that's profoundly disorienting. When you say it doesn't feel real, what do you mean?

MUTISO: Like, sometimes I come home and for a split second, I expect to see him. My brain forgets. And then I remember, and it hits me again. It's like losing him over and over.

KEVIN: That experience of forgetting and then remembering is very common in grief, Mutiso. It's your brain catching up to a reality it hasn't fully accepted. It's not a sign that you're not coping well — it's a normal part of the grieving process. And each time it happens and you get through it, you're processing the loss a little more. It does get less sharp over time, though it may never fully go away. And that's okay too.

NZOMO: Mine is different. My mum and dad separated last year. My dad moved out. I see him on some weekends but our relationship is different now. It feels like I lost my family — not a person, but the idea of what my family was supposed to be.

KEVIN: Nzomo, that's a really profound way to describe it — losing the idea of your family. That's a form of grief that often goes unrecognized because no one died, but the life you expected to have changed fundamentally. It sounds like you're mourning not just your dad's physical absence but the vision of your family being together. How has that been for you?

NZOMO: Confusing. I go back and forth between being angry and being sad. Sometimes I'm angry at my dad for leaving. Sometimes I'm sad that things couldn't work. Sometimes I feel guilty, like maybe it was my fault. Even though I know logically it wasn't.

KEVIN: Nzomo, those feelings — anger, sadness, guilt — are all completely normal responses to parental separation. And I want to say this clearly: it was not your fault. When parents separate, children often feel responsible, but the decision was between your parents and about their relationship. Not about you. And feeling confused about your emotions — angry one day, sad the next — that's called ambiguous grief. The loss isn't clean or final, your dad is still in your life but in a different way, so the grief comes in waves with different feelings each time.

BETH: Can I go?

KEVIN: Of course, Beth.

BETH: Mine is... hard to talk about. My cousin died in December. She was only nineteen. She took her own life. And I don't understand why. We were close. She was always smiling, always the life of the party. No one saw it coming. And I keep thinking — I should have seen something. I should have known. I should have asked her how she was really doing instead of just assuming she was fine because she looked fine.

KEVIN: Beth, I am so sorry. Losing someone to suicide is one of the most painful forms of grief because it comes with so many questions that may never have answers. And the guilt you're feeling — "I should have known, I should have seen it" — that's a very normal response, but I want you to hear something important: it is not your fault. People who are struggling don't always show it. Your cousin's pain was hidden, and that's not because you failed her. It's because sometimes people hide their pain so well that even the people closest to them don't see it.

BETH: But what if I had just asked? What if one conversation could have changed things?

KEVIN: That "what if" is one of the heaviest things a person can carry. And I won't pretend I can give you an answer, because I can't. What I can tell you is that you loved her, and you didn't know. You couldn't have fixed something you couldn't see. And carrying that guilt — it doesn't honour her memory. What honours her memory is you being here, talking about it, being open about how you feel, and maybe one day using that experience to be the person who does ask. Who checks in. Who doesn't assume everyone is fine. But right now, right here? You need to give yourself grace. Can you try to do that?

BETH: I don't know. I'll try.

[00:20]

KEVIN: Thank you for trusting us with that, Beth. I know that wasn't easy. I want everyone to know — what Beth shared is heavy, and it's okay if it brings up feelings for you too. Take a moment if you need it. And if anyone ever finds themselves in a dark place, or if you notice someone around you who seems to be struggling, please — reach out. Talk to someone. There is always help available.

OUMA: I haven't shared yet. My thing is smaller, like way smaller after what Beth just said. I feel weird even saying it now.

KEVIN: Ouma, there's no ranking of pain. Your experience matters too. Please share.

OUMA: Okay. I lost my spot on the school basketball team. I'd been on the team since Form One and this year the new coach cut me. It was humiliating. Everyone at school was like, "Why did Ouma get dropped?" I know it's just basketball, but it was my identity. Being "the basketball guy" was who I was. And now I don't know who I am without it.

KEVIN: Ouma, that is not small. Losing a role that defines your identity is a legitimate loss. You're not just grieving basketball — you're grieving a sense of self. "Who am I if I'm not the basketball guy?" That's a profound question and it takes courage to sit with it. And I don't want you to minimize your experience just because it's different from someone else's. Pain isn't a competition.

OUMA: Thanks, Kevin. I needed to hear that.

KEVIN: Now, I want to talk about something that connects all of these experiences. Whether it's a friend moving away, a grandfather dying, parents separating, a cousin's death, or losing a team — grief is the common thread. And grief is not linear. You don't go through neat stages one after another and come out the other side "fixed." Grief is messy. It comes in waves. Some days you're fine. Some days it hits you out of nowhere. Some days you're angry, some days you're numb, some days you cry at something that seems unrelated. All of that is normal.

MUTISO: That's true. Last week I cried during a Safaricom ad. An ad. Because the old man in it reminded me of my grandfather. I felt stupid.

KEVIN: You're not stupid, Mutiso. That's grief doing what grief does — connecting the present to the past through unexpected triggers. The ad wasn't the cause. It was the catalyst. Your grief was already there; the ad just gave it a doorway to come out. And honestly, letting it out is healthier than holding it in.

[00:30]

KEVIN: I want us to talk about what helps with grief. Not "fixes" — because grief isn't something to be fixed. But things that help you carry it. What's helped any of you?

ADHIAMBO: Video calling my friend. Like, we can't have lunch together anymore, but we video call on Sundays and it's become our thing. It's not the same, but it's something.

KEVIN: Adapting the relationship rather than losing it entirely. That's really healthy, Adhiambo. You found a new form for an old connection.

GLORIA: I started sleeping in my sister's old room sometimes. It still smells like her perfume. My mum thinks it's weird, but it makes me feel close to her.

KEVIN: Gloria, that's not weird at all. Comfort objects and spaces are a natural part of grieving. You're holding onto something tangible that connects you to her. As long as it brings comfort and not distress, that's a healthy way to process.

NZOMO: For me, honestly, this group. Being able to talk about my parents' separation without everyone looking at me with pity. At school, people either pity me or gossip about it. Here, people just listen. That's different.

KEVIN: Nzomo, I'm really glad this space feels safe for you. That's exactly what it's meant to be — a place where you can be honest without judgment.

MUTISO: I've been going to my grandfather's chair and just sitting in it. Not doing anything. Just sitting. Sometimes I talk to him even though he's not there. Is that normal?

KEVIN: Completely normal, Mutiso. Many people find comfort in "talking to" loved ones who have passed. It's a way of maintaining the connection. Your relationship with your grandfather didn't end when he died — it changed form. The love is still there.

KEVIN: Beth, what about you? Has anything helped?

BETH: Honestly, I've been keeping it all inside. I haven't talked about it to anyone before today. My family doesn't talk about how my cousin died. We say "she passed" but we never say how. It's like there's a wall of silence around it. Today was the first time I said the words out loud. And it was terrifying but also... I feel lighter. Like I put down something I've been carrying alone for two months.

KEVIN: Beth, the fact that you broke that silence today is incredibly brave. Carrying grief alone, especially grief surrounded by taboo and secrecy, is exhausting. You deserve to process this. And I want you to know — this doesn't have to be the last time you talk about it. If you'd like to speak with someone professionally, a grief counselor, I can help connect you. Sometimes the weight needs more than one conversation. Would you be open to that?

BETH: I think so. Yeah.

KEVIN: Good. We'll talk about that after the session. Ouma, what about you? What's helped?

OUMA: I started running. I can't play basketball with the team, but no one can stop me from running. I go in the morning before school. It clears my head. And I've actually started to think about other things I might be good at besides basketball. Maybe I'll try something new.

KEVIN: Ouma, that's a incredibly healthy response. You took the loss and found a way to channel the energy. And the openness to exploring who you are beyond basketball — that's growth. Loss can sometimes crack us open in ways that let new things in, if we let it.

[00:40]

KEVIN: Let's do something together before we close. I want each of you to say one thing to the person you've lost — or the thing you've lost — as if they were here. It can be anything. A thank you, a question, an "I miss you," whatever feels right. You don't have to, but I think it can be powerful. Take a moment to think, and then share when you're ready.

ADHIAMBO: Aisha, I miss eating with you every day. But I'm glad we still have Sundays. I'll hold onto that until we're back in the same place.

GLORIA: Wambui, I'm happy you found love. I just miss having you next door. Come visit more.

MUTISO: Guka, I miss the sound of your radio in the morning. I miss your stories. I'll try to make you proud.

NZOMO: Dad, I'm still angry, but I'm also still your son. I hope one day I understand why it had to be this way.

BETH: Amara, I'm sorry I didn't ask. I'm sorry I assumed you were okay. I'll never make that mistake with someone else. I love you. I'll always love you.

OUMA: Basketball, you taught me who I was for three years. Now I get to find out who I am without you. That's scary but maybe it's okay.

KEVIN: Thank you, everyone. Each of those was incredibly powerful. I want you to notice how it felt to say those words out loud. Sometimes we carry messages inside us that need to be released, and speaking them — even into thin air — gives them somewhere to go.

NZOMO: I didn't expect to feel emotional about that. But saying it out loud to my dad, even though he's not here, made me realize I have a lot of unspoken things.

KEVIN: And those unspoken things are heavy, Nzomo. Over time, I'd encourage you to find ways to express them — whether to your dad directly, in a letter, in a journal, or here with us. They don't have to stay trapped inside you.

[00:47]

KEVIN: Alright, let's close out. One takeaway from today. What's staying with you?

ADHIAMBO: Relationships change form but they don't have to end. Aisha is still my best friend. It just looks different now.

MUTISO: That grief isn't linear and I'm not weird for crying at ads. My feelings are just feelings. They come when they come.

GLORIA: That it's okay to be happy for someone and sad for yourself at the same time. Both are real.

NZOMO: That it's not my fault. I know that in my head, but hearing Kevin say it... I needed to hear it from someone else.

BETH: That silence doesn't help. Talking about it — even when it's terrifying — makes it lighter.

OUMA: That pain isn't a competition. My loss matters even if it's different from someone else's. And that loss can open doors, not just close them.

KEVIN: These are all incredibly mature and thoughtful takeaways. I'm proud of every one of you for showing up today and being so courageous. Grief is one of the hardest things we deal with as human beings, and you faced it today with honesty and grace. Remember — you don't have to grieve alone. This group is here. I'm here. And there are professionals who can help if you need more support. Take care of each other this week. And Beth — stay back for a minute?

BETH: Okay.

MUTISO: Thanks, Kevin.

OUMA: See everyone next week.

ADHIAMBO: Bye, everyone. And Beth — I'm here if you need me.

BETH: Thank you, Adhi.

KEVIN: See you all next week. Be gentle with yourselves.
