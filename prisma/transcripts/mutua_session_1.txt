DAVID: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for being here. I always appreciate that you make time for these sessions. Let's start with a check-in. I want each of you to tell us about one person who made your day better this week. It could be a friend, a family member, a teacher, a stranger — anyone. Zawadi, want to kick us off?

ZAWADI: My little sister. She drew me a picture of the two of us and put it on my desk without saying anything. I found it when I came home from school. It was so cute I almost cried.

DAVID: That is so sweet, Zawadi. It sounds like your sister really looks up to you. There's something special about someone doing something kind without being asked, right? It shows they were thinking about you even when you weren't there. Kamau?

KAMAU: My friend Otieno. We had a disagreement on Monday and I was worried the friendship was ruined. But on Wednesday he texted me and said, "Bro, that argument was stupid. We're good." And that was it. No drama. I really respected that.

DAVID: Kamau, that's a really meaningful example. The ability to repair after conflict — that's one of the most important skills in any relationship. And the fact that Otieno reached out first shows maturity. How did it feel to get that text?

KAMAU: Honestly? Relieved. Like, a weight came off my chest. I'd been overthinking it for two days.

DAVID: That relief you felt — that's connection. When a relationship matters to us, the threat of losing it creates real stress. And when it's repaired, there's genuine relief. That's a sign of how much your friendships mean to you. Mercy?

MERCY: My teacher, Mrs. Wafula. I've been struggling in English, and after class she pulled me aside — not to scold me, but to ask if I was okay. She said she noticed I seemed distracted lately. Nobody else had noticed. Or if they did, they didn't say anything.

DAVID: Mercy, it sounds like that really meant something to you — being seen by someone when you felt invisible. That's a powerful thing. Thank you for sharing that. Hassan?

HASSAN: My mum. She made my favourite meal — biryani — on Tuesday for no reason. Just because. When I asked why, she said, "Do I need a reason to cook for my son?" That hit me.

DAVID: Mothers have a way of showing love through food, don't they? And the fact that there was no occasion — that's unconditional care. She was thinking about what would make you happy. That's love in its simplest form. Brenda?

BRENDA: My desk mate at school, Rita. I forgot my calculator for the math exam and she gave me hers without hesitating. She did her entire exam without a calculator so I could have one. I still can't believe she did that.

DAVID: Wow, Brenda. That's sacrifice. Rita put your need ahead of her own convenience. That's the kind of friendship that you don't take for granted. Did you get to thank her properly?

BRENDA: I bought her chips after school. But honestly, I still feel like it wasn't enough. She might have done worse on her exam because of me.

DAVID: The fact that you're thinking about that shows you value the relationship. And I'm sure Rita doesn't see it as a loss — she sees it as what friends do. That gives us a great lead-in to today's topic. Silas?

SILAS: My older brother. He's in university in Eldoret, so I don't see him much. But he called me on Sunday just to talk. Not about anything specific. Just to catch up. We talked for like forty minutes about everything and nothing. I really miss him, so that call meant a lot.

DAVID: Silas, I can hear how much that connection means to you. Distance can make relationships harder, but it sounds like your brother makes the effort to bridge that gap. That's really valuable. And wanting to stay connected despite distance — that's a strength in both of you.

DAVID: So, notice what everyone shared. Every single story was about a relationship. A sister drawing a picture. A friend repairing a conflict. A teacher noticing you. A mum cooking your favourite meal. A desk mate sacrificing her calculator. A brother calling from far away. These moments — they're not small. They're the building blocks of something incredibly important, which is today's topic: Building Positive Relationships.

[00:10]

DAVID: So let me ask this — what makes a relationship positive? When you think of a really good friendship or a really good relationship with a family member, what qualities does it have?

KAMAU: Trust. Like, you have to be able to trust the person.

MERCY: Communication. Being able to actually talk openly.

BRENDA: Respect. Even when you disagree.

SILAS: Being there. Not just when things are fun, but when things are hard.

ZAWADI: Honesty. Even if it's uncomfortable sometimes.

HASSAN: Feeling safe. Like, you can be yourself without being judged.

DAVID: These are all brilliant answers, and they actually cover most of what research tells us about healthy relationships. Trust, communication, respect, reliability, honesty, and safety. I want to dig into a few of these because while we know they matter, actually practicing them can be harder than it sounds. Let's start with communication, since Mercy brought it up. What does good communication look like in a friendship?

MERCY: I think it's being able to tell your friend how you feel without them getting defensive. Like, if something bothers me, I should be able to say it.

DAVID: That's really important, Mercy. And I want to highlight something you said — "without them getting defensive." That's key, because communication is a two-way street. It's not just about speaking honestly; it's also about how the other person receives what you say. And here's where it gets interesting — the way you say something matters as much as what you say. For example, there's a big difference between "You never listen to me" and "I feel unheard sometimes." Same message, but the second one is less likely to make the other person defensive. Has anyone experienced the difference between those two approaches?

KAMAU: Yeah, actually. That argument with Otieno I mentioned? It started because I said, "You always cancel on me." And he felt attacked, so he got defensive, and then we both got heated. But later, when we talked it out, I said something more like, "I feel let down when plans change last minute." And he actually heard me that time.

DAVID: Kamau, that's a textbook example of what psychologists call "I" statements versus "You" statements. When you say "You always..." it feels like an accusation, and the other person's instinct is to defend themselves. But when you say "I feel..." it's about your experience, and it invites the other person to understand rather than fight back. That distinction alone can transform how you communicate in every relationship.

ZAWADI: But don't you think some people just don't care? Like, no matter how nicely you say it, they don't listen?

DAVID: That's a really honest question, Zawadi. And yes, sometimes people aren't in a place to hear us, no matter how well we communicate. That doesn't mean the communication skills are useless — it means that relationship might need something else, like time, or space, or in some cases, boundaries. And that's actually another really important part of positive relationships — boundaries.

[00:20]

DAVID: So let's talk about boundaries. What comes to mind when you hear that word?

HASSAN: Keeping people out?

BRENDA: Rules?

DAVID: Those are common associations, but boundaries aren't about keeping people out or being rigid. Boundaries are about knowing what you're comfortable with and communicating that clearly. It's about protecting your well-being while still being in the relationship. For example, a boundary might be: "I care about you, but I can't always be available at midnight to talk about problems. Can we talk during the day instead?" That's not rejection — that's healthy self-care.

MERCY: I'm really bad at boundaries. I always say yes to everything because I don't want people to be upset with me. And then I get exhausted and resentful. Is that common?

DAVID: Mercy, that is incredibly common, and I'm really glad you brought it up. A lot of people — especially people who are naturally caring and empathetic — struggle with boundaries because they don't want to disappoint others. But here's the thing: a relationship where you can't say no isn't a healthy relationship. If someone only values you when you're saying yes to everything, that's not genuine connection — that's convenience. Healthy relationships make space for "no."

SILAS: That's hard though. Especially with family. Like, my parents expect certain things from me and I can't exactly set boundaries with them. If I said "I need space," they'd think I was being disrespectful.

DAVID: That's a really important cultural point, Silas. In our context — in Kenyan families, in East African culture — the relationship with parents has specific expectations around respect and obedience. And I'm not suggesting you throw all of that away. But boundaries can look different in different relationships. With parents, it might not be saying "I need space," but it might be finding moments to express yourself honestly within the framework of respect. Like, "Dad, I hear what you're saying, and I want to do well. Can I share what's been hard for me?" That's a boundary — you're being honest about your experience without being disrespectful.

SILAS: I've never thought of it that way. Like, it doesn't have to be all or nothing.

DAVID: Exactly. Boundaries exist on a spectrum. And they look different with friends, family, romantic relationships, and even acquaintances. The core principle is the same — knowing what you need and communicating it with kindness. Okay, I want to shift to another aspect of positive relationships — support. Earlier, Silas mentioned "being there, not just when things are fun, but when things are hard." Can someone give an example of a time when someone really showed up for you during a difficult moment?

BRENDA: When my grandfather passed away last year, most people said "Pole" and moved on. Which I understand — what else can you say? But my friend Rita — the calculator girl — she came to my house three days in a row. She didn't even say much. She'd just sit with me. Sometimes we'd talk, sometimes we'd just watch TV. She never tried to fix it or give me advice. She was just... there. That meant more than anything anyone said.

DAVID: Brenda, thank you for sharing that. I can tell it still moves you. And what you described is something really profound — the power of presence. Sometimes the best thing you can do for someone isn't to fix their problem or give advice. It's to simply be there. To sit with them in their pain without trying to change it. That's one of the deepest forms of support, and not everyone knows how to do it. Rita sounds like an extraordinary friend.

BRENDA: She is. She really is.

ZAWADI: I think that's one of the hardest things though. When someone you love is hurting and you can't fix it. It makes you feel helpless. So you try to say something smart or give advice, but really you're doing it for yourself, to feel less helpless. Not for them.

DAVID: Zawadi, that is an incredibly insightful observation. You're absolutely right — sometimes our advice is more about soothing our own discomfort than helping the other person. And recognizing that is actually a huge step toward being a better friend. When someone is in pain, before jumping to solutions, you can ask yourself: "Do they need advice, or do they need me to listen?" And if you're not sure, you can just ask them: "Do you want me to help problem-solve, or do you just need me to listen right now?" That one question can change the whole dynamic.

[00:30]

DAVID: Let's move to another aspect of relationships that I think is really important but sometimes uncomfortable to talk about — conflict. Every relationship has conflict. It's unavoidable. The question isn't whether you'll have disagreements — it's how you handle them. Kamau already gave us a great example with his and Otieno's argument. But I want to explore this more. What usually goes wrong when you have a conflict with a friend?

HASSAN: Ego. Nobody wants to be the first one to apologize.

KAMAU: Assumptions. Like, you assume you know why the other person did what they did, and you get angry about a reason you made up in your head.

MERCY: For me, I avoid the conflict entirely. I pretend everything's fine when it really isn't. And then it builds up until I explode.

DAVID: These are all incredibly common patterns. Hassan, you mentioned ego — and that's huge. Sometimes we'd rather lose a friendship than lose an argument do, and looking back, it makes no sense. Kamau, assumptions — mind reading is so dangerous in relationships. We create entire stories about what someone meant and we never actually check with them. And Mercy, avoidance — stuffing your feelings until they overflow. This one is especially common with people who struggle with boundaries, which connects to what you shared earlier.

MERCY: Yeah, it all connects. I don't set boundaries, so I get resentful, and then I avoid the conflict, and then it blows up.

DAVID: And recognizing that pattern is the first step to changing it. Now let me offer something practical. When conflict happens, there's a three-step approach that can help. First — pause. Don't respond in the heat of the moment. Give yourself time to cool down. Even ten minutes can make a huge difference. Second — reflect. Ask yourself: what am I actually feeling? What do I need from this situation? And is there something I might be assuming that I should check? Third — communicate. Use those "I" statements Kamau demonstrated. Share your feelings and needs without attacking the other person.

SILAS: Pause, reflect, communicate. That's easy to remember.

DAVID: And hard to practice! Especially the pausing part. When you're angry, every part of you wants to fire back immediately. But that ten-minute pause can be the difference between resolving a conflict and losing a friend.

ZAWADI: What about when you're the one who messed up? Like, what's the right way to apologize?

DAVID: Great question, Zawadi. A genuine apology has a few components. First, you acknowledge what you did — specifically. Not "I'm sorry if I upset you," but "I'm sorry I said that thing about you in front of other people." Second, you acknowledge how it affected the other person: "I understand that must have been embarrassing and hurtful." Third, you express genuine remorse: "That wasn't okay and I feel terrible about it." And fourth — and this is the one most people skip — you share what you'll do differently: "I'm going to be more careful about how I talk about personal things in public." A good apology isn't just "sorry." It's "I see what I did, I see how it hurt you, and here's how I'm going to be better."

HASSAN: That's a lot more than just saying "my bad."

DAVID: Ha! Yes, it is. "My bad" works for small things — bumping into someone, forgetting to reply to a text. But for real harm in a relationship, you need a real apology. And here's the other side of it — receiving an apology also matters. When someone apologizes sincerely, try to receive it with grace. You don't have to immediately be okay, but acknowledging the effort someone made to apologize creates space for repair.

[00:40]

DAVID: We're getting close to the end, so I want to zoom out and talk about one more thing — choosing your relationships intentionally. As you get older, you start to realize that not every relationship is good for you. Some friendships drain you. Some relationships make you feel worse about yourself. And it's okay to recognize that and make choices about who you invest your time and energy in. That doesn't make you mean or disloyal. It makes you wise.

BRENDA: How do you know when a friendship is toxic though? Like, sometimes it's obvious — the person is always putting you down. But sometimes it's subtle and you can't put your finger on it.

DAVID: That's a really mature question, Brenda. Here are some signs: you consistently feel worse about yourself after spending time with them. You feel like you're always giving and never receiving. You can't be yourself around them — you have to filter everything. They're only there for the fun times, never the hard times. They guilt-trip you when you set boundaries. They talk about you behind your back. Any of these sound familiar to anyone?

KAMAU: A few of them, yeah. I have a friend — well, more of a classmate — who constantly makes jokes about me in front of other people. When I told him it bothers me, he said I was being too sensitive. That felt really dismissive.

DAVID: And that's a red flag, Kamau. When someone dismisses your feelings and tells you you're "too sensitive" for having them, that's a form of invalidation. A healthy friend would hear you say "That bothers me" and take it seriously. They might not have realized they were doing it, and a good response would be: "I'm sorry, I didn't know it was hurtful. I'll stop." Instead, he flipped it back on you. That's worth paying attention to.

KAMAU: Yeah. I've been pulling back from that friendship a bit.

DAVID: And that's okay. You don't have to have a dramatic confrontation or a big announcement. Sometimes pulling back is the healthy choice. You can be polite and respectful without being close. Not everyone in your life needs to be in your inner circle.

ZAWADI: I love that. Not everyone needs to be in your inner circle. I think I try to keep too many people close and then I get spread thin.

DAVID: Your energy is finite, Zawadi. You can be kind to everyone, but you can't be deeply invested in everyone. Choose the relationships that lift you up, that challenge you positively, that make you feel seen and valued. And invest in those.

HASSAN: This whole session is making me realize I need to be a better friend. Like, I don't check in on people enough. I kind of just assume everyone's fine unless they tell me otherwise. But after hearing what Mercy said about her teacher being the only one who noticed — I want to be someone who notices.

DAVID: Hassan, that right there tells me you're already a better friend than you give yourself credit for. The willingness to reflect and want to improve — that's rare. And the good news is, being a more attentive friend isn't about grand gestures. It's about small, consistent actions. A text that says "How are you doing?" A genuine question at lunch. Remembering something someone told you and following up. These small things build enormous trust over time.

[00:48]

DAVID: Alright, let's wrap up. I want each of you to share one thing from today's session that you want to carry with you. One insight, one practice, one idea. Let's go around.

ZAWADI: For me, it's the idea that not everyone needs to be in my inner circle. I want to be more intentional about where I put my energy. Quality over quantity.

KAMAU: I'm going to practice "I" statements. That one change in how I communicate could save me a lot of unnecessary arguments. And I want to stop mind reading — just ask people what they meant instead of assuming.

MERCY: Boundaries. I need to start saying no sometimes without feeling guilty. And I need to stop avoiding conflict. That cycle of avoid-avoid-avoid-explode is not working for me.

DAVID: Mercy, recognizing the cycle is really powerful. Be patient with yourself as you start to change it. It won't happen overnight, but every small boundary you set is progress.

HASSAN: I want to be someone who notices. Like Mrs. Wafula noticed Mercy. I want to check in on my friends more, especially the ones who don't always speak up.

DAVID: That's a beautiful intention, Hassan. The world needs more people who notice.

BRENDA: My takeaway is the power of presence. Sometimes you don't need to fix anything. You just need to show up. I want to be like Rita for someone else.

DAVID: And you will be, Brenda. The fact that you recognize the value of presence means you already have that ability. You just have to trust it.

SILAS: For me, it's the boundaries thing, but specifically with family. The idea that I can be honest within the framework of respect — that feels like something I can actually do. I don't have to choose between being respectful and being real. I can do both.

DAVID: Silas, that's a really nuanced and mature takeaway. Both respect and honesty can coexist, and navigating that balance is one of the most important relationship skills you'll ever develop.

DAVID: Everyone, this has been a really rich conversation. You've all been incredibly honest and thoughtful. I want to leave you with this: positive relationships aren't something that just happen to you. They're something you build, day by day, through small choices — how you listen, how you communicate, how you show up, how you repair, and how you set boundaries. You have more power in your relationships than you think. Use it wisely. I'll see you all next week.

HASSAN: Thanks, David. This was one of the best sessions.

MERCY: Agreed. I needed this.

KAMAU: See you all next week.

DAVID: Take care, everyone. Go be good friends to each other — and to yourselves.

END OF SESSION
